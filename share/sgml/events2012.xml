    <description>This year Beastie joins Tux on his tour in Vienna in
      May: another "DanuBSDCon" is coming to gather Central-European BSD
      people to meet!  The event features several BSD developers and
      enthusiasts to tell about their work, communicate with their fellows
      and reach their potential future partners.  As usual, there are no
      formalities, papers, registration or participation fee, however the
      invited folks are encouraged to give a brief talk about their
      favorite BSD-related topic.  The goal is to motivate everybody,
      especially university students to work with BSD
      systems.
