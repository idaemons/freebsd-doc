                2016-09-27 19:36:12 UTC (releng/11.0, 11.0-RELEASE-p1)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The libarchive(3) library provides a flexible interface for reading and
writing streaming archive files such as tar(1) and cpio(1), and has been the
basis for the FreeBSD implementation of the tar(1) and cpio(1) utilities
since FreeBSD 5.3.

II.  Problem Description

Flaws in libarchive's handling of symlinks and hard links allow overwriting
files outside the extraction directory, or permission changes to a directory
outside the extraction directory.

III. Impact

An attacker who can control freebsd-update's or portsnap's input to tar can
change file content or permisssions on files outside of the update tool's
working sandbox.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

No reboot is needed.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility.

This advisory is released concurrently with FreeBSD-SA-16:29.bspatch
which contains special instructions for using freebsd-update. Following
the instructions in that advisory will safely apply updates for
FreeBSD-SA-16:29.bspatch, FreeBSD-SA-16:30.portsnap, and
FreeBSD-SA-16:31.libarchive.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:31/libarchive.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:31/libarchive.patch.asc
# gpg --verify libarchive.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
