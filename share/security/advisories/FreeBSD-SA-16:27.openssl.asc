                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          Regression in OpenSSL suite

Category:       contrib
Module:         openssl
Announced:      2016-10-10
Credits:        OpenSSL Project
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected:      2016-09-26 14:30:19 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-STABLE)
                2016-09-26 20:26:19 UTC (releng/11.0, 11.0-RELEASE-p1)
CVE Name:       CVE-2016-7052

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project.  The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

II.  Problem Description

The OpenSSL version included in FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE is 1.0.2i.  The version
has bug fix for CVE-2016-7052, which should have included CRL sanity check,
but the check was omitted.

III. Impact

Any attempt to use CRLs in OpenSSL 1.0.2i will crash with a null pointer
exception.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:27/openssl.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:27/openssl.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

Branch/path                                                      Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

releng/11.0/                                                      r306354
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:

# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

<URL:https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN>
