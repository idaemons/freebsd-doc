For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:http://security.freebsd.org/>.

I.   Background

The Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of
its file systems that can be any kind of file systems such like UFS, ZFS
etcetera, so that other hosts can access them over the network and mount
them as if they were on local disks.

II.  Problem Description

In a configuration where two or more clients mount a ZFS file system over
NFSv4 from a FreeBSD server, if client1 caches a directory listing and a
file in the directory is renamed on client2, then client1 can end up in
a state where the cached but incorrect directory contents persists indefinitely
and is never updated.

III. Impact

When client2 renames a file or directory, client1 does not receive the
changed attributes and never does a READDIR to get the updated contents.
This could result in a client that has incorrect information about the
actual content of the mounted file system.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

2) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

3) To update your present system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-14:12/zfs.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-14:12/zfs.patch.asc
# gpg --verify zfs.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/zfs.patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.
