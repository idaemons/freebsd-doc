      Now celebrating its 14th year, the Southern California Linux
      Expo SCALE 14X is the largest Linux and Open Source Software
      show in North America. The four-day event -- from Jan 21-24,
      2016, at the Pasadena Convention Center -- attracts top speakers
      and exhibitors from all over North America.  Sessions and
      workshops range from beginner tutorials to seminars for
      experienced system administrators or software developers.  In
      addition, specialty seminars prior to the weekend are conducted
      by various groups in the Free and Open Source Software
      community.  While Linux is in our name, we tend to have a fair
      amount of BSD content including booths from the FreeBSD
      Foundation and the FreeBSD project.  This year will also include
      onsite BSDA exams.  For more information, or to register, visit
