    <description>Watch out, another BSD-Day is rising: next April
      Beastie visits Naples to gather BSD people of Italy and Central
      Europe to meet up!  This event is an excellent opportunity for
      BSD developers and enthusiasts to present their work to larger
      audiences, share their thoughts with their fellows and reach out
      for their potential partners.  Traditionally, the event tries to
      avoid formalities as it does not require the speakers to submit
      papers or the attendees to register or pay an entry fee.
      However, the invited folks are encouraged to a give a brief talk
      on their favorite BSD topic.  The goal is to motivate everybody,
      especially university students to see the benefits of our
      approach and take a chance on working with BSD
      systems.</description>
