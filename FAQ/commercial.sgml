    <heading>Commercial Applications<label id="commercial"></heading>

    <p><bf/NOTE/ This section is still very sparse, though we're hoping, of
    course, that companies will add to it! :) The FreeBSD group has no
    financial interest in any of the companies listed here but simply
    lists them as a public service (and feels that commercial interest
    in FreeBSD can have very positive effects on FreeBSD's long-term
    viability).  We encourage commercial software vendors to send their
    entries here for inclusion.  See 
    <url url="../commercial/commercial.html" name="the Vendors page">
    for a longer list.
