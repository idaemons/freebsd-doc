    <p>Welcome to the FreeBSD 2.X FAQ!

    <sect1>
      <heading>What is the purpose of this FAQ?</heading>

      <p>As is usual with Usenet FAQs, this document aims to cover the most
      frequently asked questions concerning the FreeBSD operating system
      (and of course answer them!).  Although originally intended to reduce
      bandwidth and avoid the same old questions being asked over and over
      again, FAQs have become recognized as valuable information resources.

      <p>Every effort has been made to make this FAQ as informative as
      possible; if you have any suggestions as to how it may be improved,
      please feel free to mail them to the <url url="mailto:pds@FreeBSD.ORG"
      name="FAQ maintainer">.

    <sect1>
      <heading>What is FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>Briefly, FreeBSD 2.X is a UN*X-like operating system based on
      U.C. Berkeley's 4.4BSD-lite release for the i386 platform.  It is
      also based indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C. Berkeley's
      Net/2 to the i386, known as 386BSD, though very little of the 386BSD
      code remains.  A fuller description of what FreeBSD is and how
      it can work for you may be found on the <url url="http://www.freebsd.org"
      name="FreeBSD home page">.

      <p>FreeBSD is used by companies, Internet Service Providers, researchers,
      computer professionals, students and home users all over the world
      in their work, education and recreation.  See some of them in the
      <url url="http://www.freebsd.org/gallery.html" name="FreeBSD Gallery.">

      <p>For more detailed information on FreeBSD, please see the
      <url url="../handbook/handbook.html" name="FreeBSD Handbook.">

    <sect1>
      <heading>What are the goals of FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>The goals of the FreeBSD Project are to provide software that may
      be used for any purpose and without strings attached.  Many of us
      have a significant investment in the code (and project) and would
      certainly not mind a little financial renumeration now and then,
      but we're definitely not prepared to insist on it.  We believe
      that our first and foremost "mission" is to provide code to any
      and all comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets
      the widest possible use and provides the widest possible benefit.
      This is, we believe, one of the most fundamental goals of Free
      Software and one that we enthusiastically support.

      <p>That code in our source tree which falls under the GNU Public License
      (GPL) or GNU Library Public License (GLPL) comes with slightly more
      strings attached, though at least on the side of enforced
      access rather than the usual opposite.  Due to the additional
      complexities that can evolve in the commercial use of GPL software,
      we do, however, endeavor to replace such software with submissions
      under the more relaxed BSD copyright whenever possible.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Why is it called FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>
      <itemize>
        <item>It may be used free of charge, even by commercial users.

        <item>Full source for the operating system is freely available, and
        the minimum possible restrictions have been placed upon its
        use, distribution and incorporation into other work (commercial
        or non-commercial).

        <item>Anyone who has an improvement and/or bug fix is free to submit
        their code and have it added to the source tree (subject to
        one or two obvious provisos).
      </itemize>

      <p>For those of our readers whose first language is not English, it
      may be worth pointing out that the word ``free'' is being used in two
      ways here, one meaning ``at no cost'', the other meaning ``you can do
      whatever you like''.  Apart from one or two things you <tt /cannot/
      do with the FreeBSD code, for example pretending you wrote it, you
      really can do whatever you like with it.

    <sect1>
      <heading>What is the latest version of FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>Version <url url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.2.5-RELEASE"
      name="2.2.5"> is the latest <em>stable</em> version; it was released
      in October, 1997.  This is also the latest <em>release</em> version.

      <p>Briefly explained, <bf>-stable</bf> is aimed at the ISP or other
      corporate user who wants stability and a low change count over
      the wizzy new features of the latest release.  At the moment, these
      versions are one and the same, but it shouldn't be long before the
      <bf>-current</bf> branch is polished enough for general release.

      <p>This is not to say that a 3.0-current snapshot is unusable for
      business services, and many people who need some 3.0 specific feature
      (newer compiler technology, faster networking code, etc) have decided
      to take a chance with it with very good results.  We simply do not
      wish to "certify" 3.0 as mission-worthy until it's been better
      shaken-out.

    <sect1>
      <heading>What is FreeBSD-current?<label id="current"></heading>

      <p><url url="../handbook/current.html" name="FreeBSD-current"> is the
      development version of the operating system, which will in due
      course become 3.0-RELEASE.  As such, it is really only of interest
      to developers working on the system and die-hard hobbyists.
      See the <url url="../handbook/current.html" name="relevant section">
      in the <url url="../handbook/handbook.html" name="handbook"> for
      details on running -current.

      <p>If you are not familiar with the operating system or are not
      capable of identifying the difference between a real problem and
      a temporary problem, you should not use FreeBSD-current.  This
      branch sometimes evolves quite quickly and can be un-buildable
      for a number of days at a time.  People that use FreeBSD-current
      are expected to be able to analyze any problems and only report them
      if they are deemed to be mistakes rather than ``glitches''.  Questions
      such as ``make world produces some error about groups'' on the
      -current mailing list are sometimes treated with contempt.

      <p>Every now and again, a <url url="../releases/snapshots.html"
      name="snapshot"> release is also made of this -current development
      code, CDROM distributions of the occasional snapshot even now being
      made available. The goals behind each snapshot release are:

      <itemize>
        <item>To test the latest version of the installation software.

        <item>To give people who would like to run -current but who don't
        have the time and/or bandwidth to follow it on a day-to-day
        basis an easy way of bootstrapping it onto their systems.

        <item>To preserve a fixed reference point for the code in question,
        just in case we break something really badly later. (Although
        CVS normally prevents anything horrible like this happening :)

        <item>To ensure that any new features in need of testing have the
        greatest possible number of potential testers.
      </itemize>

      <p>No claims are made that any snapshot can be considered
      ``production quality'' for any purpose.  For stability
      and tested mettle, you will have to stick to full releases.

      <p>Snapshot releases are directly available from <url
      url="ftp://current.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/"> and are generated,
      on the average, once a day for both the 3.0-current and 2.2-stable
      branches.

    <sect1>
      <heading>What is the FreeBSD-stable concept?</heading>

      <p>Back when FreeBSD 2.0.5 was released, we decided to branch FreeBSD
      development into two parts.  One branch was named <url
      url="../handbook/stable.html" name="-stable">, with the
      intention that only well-tested bug fixes and small incremental
      enhancements would be made to it (for Internet Service Providers
      and other commercial enterprises for whom sudden shifts or
      experimental features are quite undesirable).  The other branch was
      <url url="../handbook/current.html" name="-current">, which
      essentially has been one unbroken line leading towards 3.0-RELEASE
      (and beyond) since 2.0 was released. If a little ASCII art would
      help, this is how it looks:

<verb>
                  2.0
                   |
                   |
                   |  [2.1-stable]
  *BRANCH*       2.0.5 -> 2.1 -> 2.1.5 -> 2.1.6 -> 2.1.7.1  [2.1-stable ends]
                   |                            (Mar 1997)
                   |
                   |
                   |  [2.2-stable]
  *BRANCH*      2.2.1 -> 2.2.2-RELEASE -> 2.2.5-RELEASE -> ...
                   |       (Mar 1997)      (Oct 1997)
                   |
                   |
                3.0-SNAPs  (started Q1 1997)
                   |
                   |
              3.0.0-RELEASE (Q1 1998)
                   |
                  \|/
                   +
           [future 3.x releases]
</verb>

      <p>The -current branch is slowly progressing towards 3.0 and beyond,
      whereas the previous 2.1-stable branch was superceded by the
      release of 2.2.0, the new "stability branch" aka 2.2-stable.
      3.0-current will continue to be where the active development takes
      place, up until the actual release of 3.0.  At that point, 3.0 will
      become yet another branch and 3.1-current will become the next
      "current branch".

    <sect1>
      <heading>Why did the 2.1-stable branch end with 2.1.7.1?</heading>

      <p>While we'd certainly like to be able to continue 3 branches of
      development, we've found that the version control tools available to
      us are not particularly well-suited for this; in fact, they quickly
      result in a maintenance nightmare for any branch which lives much
      beyond 2-3 months. The 2.1-stable branch has, by contrast, lasted for
      well over a year and what little sanity the FreeBSD developers have
      left would be in serious jeopardy if we continued in this way.
      Perhaps in the future we'll figure out another model which gives
      everyone what they want, and we are working on such a model, but in
      the meantime it's probably best to think of the old -stable coming
      to an end with <url
      url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/pub/2.1.7.1-RELEASE"
      name="2.1.7.1-RELEASE"> (the final point release after 2.1.7), and
      the new -stable beginning with 2.2.2.

    <sect1>
      <heading>When are FreeBSD releases made?</heading>

      <p>As a general principle, the FreeBSD core team only release a new
      version of FreeBSD when they believe that there are sufficient new
      features and/or bug fixes to justify one, and are satisfied that the
      changes made have settled down sufficiently to avoid compromising the
      stability of the release.  Many users regard this caution as one of
      the best things about FreeBSD, although it can be a little
      frustrating when waiting for all the latest goodies to become
      available...

      <p>Releases are made about every 6 months on average.

      <p>For people needing (or wanting) a little more excitement, there are
      SNAPs released more frequently, particularly during the month or so
      leading up to a release.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Is FreeBSD only available for PCs ?</heading>

      <p>At present, yes, though a port to the DEC Alpha architecture
      is under way.  If your machine has a different architecture and
      you need something right now, we suggest you look at
      <url url="http://www.netbsd.org/" name="NetBSD"> or
      <url url="http://www.openbsd.org/" name="OpenBSD">.

    <sect1>
      <heading> Who is responsible for FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>The key decisions concerning the FreeBSD project, such as the
      overall direction of the project and who is allowed to add code to
      the source tree, are made by a <url url="../handbook/staff:core.html"
      name="core team"> of some 17 people. There is a much larger team of
      around 80+ <url url="../handbook/staff:committers.html"
      name="committers"> who are authorized to make changes directly to the
      FreeBSD source tree.

      <p>However, most non-trivial changes are discussed in advance in the
      <ref id="mailing" name="mailing lists">, and there are no restrictions
      on who may take part in the discussion.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Where can I get FreeBSD?<label id="where-get"></heading>

      <p>Every significant release of FreeBSD is available via anonymous ftp
      from the <url url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/"
      name="FreeBSD FTP site">:

      <itemize>
        <item>For the current 2.2-stable release, 2.2.5R see the
        <url url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/2.2.5-RELEASE/"
        name="2.2.5-RELEASE"> directory.

        <item>For the current 3.0-current release, 3.0-SNAP, see the
        <url url="ftp://current.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/" name="3.0"> directory.

        <item><url url="ftp://releng22.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/"
        name="2.2 Snapshot"> releases are made once a day along the
        RELENG_2_2 branch (2.2.5 -> 2.2.x) as it winds its way towards the
        next point release on the 2.2 branch. With the occasional
        exception of accidental breakage, the RELENG_2_2 branch is
        being carefully maintained (no experimental changes, fixes made
        only after testing in -current).

        <item><url url="ftp://current.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/"
        name="3.0 Snapshot">releases are also made once a day for the
        <ref id="current" name="-current"> branch, these being of service
        purely to bleeding-edge testers and developers.
      </itemize>

        <item>The main channel is &num;FreeBSD on the EFNET. You can
        use your regular IRC server for it.

        <item>You can point your IRC client to <tt/irc.FreeBSD.org/

      <p>Greg Lehey's book ``Installing and Running FreeBSD'' is available
      from Walnut Creek and ships with the 2.2.5 CDROM.  There is also
      a larger book entitled ``The Complete FreeBSD'', which comes with
      additional printed manpages and includes the 2.2.5 CDROM set.  It
      should be available in most good book shops now.

      <p>There is a FreeBSD Documentation Project which you may contact (or
      even better, join) on the <tt>doc</tt> mailing list:
      <url url="mailto:doc@FreeBSD.ORG" name="&lt;doc@FreeBSD.ORG&gt;">.

      <p>A FreeBSD ``handbook'' is available, and can be found as:
      <url url="../handbook/handbook.html" name="the FreeBSD Handbook">.
      Note that this is a work in progress, and so parts may be incomplete.

      <p>However, as FreeBSD 2.2.X is based upon Berkeley 4.4BSD-Lite2, most
      of the 4.4BSD manuals are applicable to FreeBSD 2.2.X.  O'Reilly

      (approx. US&dollar;45-&dollar;55), but worth it.  It also
      includes a CDROM with the sources for various tools; most of
      these, however, are also on the FreeBSD 2.2.5R CDROM (and the
