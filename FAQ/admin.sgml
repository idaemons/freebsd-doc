      <heading>Where are the system start-up configuration files?</heading>

      <p>From 2.0.5R to 2.2.1R, the primary configuration file is
      <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt>. All the options are to be specified in
      this file and other files such as <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc" name="/etc/rc"> and
      <tt>/etc/netstart</tt> just include it.

      <p>Look in the <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt> file and change the value to
      match your system. This file is filled with comments to show what
      to put in there.

      <p>In post-2.2.1 and 3.0, <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt> was renamed
      to a more self-describing <htmlurl 
      url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc.conf(5)" name="rc.conf">
      file and the syntax cleaned up a bit in the process.
      <tt>/etc/netstart</tt> was also renamed to <tt>/etc/rc.network</tt>
      so that all files could be copied with a <tt><htmlurl 
      url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?cp" name="cp"> /usr/src/etc/rc*
      /etc</tt> command.

      <p><tt>/etc/rc.local</tt> is here as always and may be used to
      start up additional local services like <htmlurl
      url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?^inn" name="INN">
      or set custom options.

      <p>The <tt>/etc/rc.serial</tt> is for serial port initialization
      (e.g. locking the port characteristics, and so on.).

      <p>The <tt>/etc/rc.i386</tt> is for Intel-specifics settings, such
      as iBCS2 emulation or the PC system console configuration.

      <p>Starting with 2.1.0R, you can also have "local" startup files in a
      directory specified in <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt> (or
      <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>):

      <verb>
        # Location of local startup files.
        local_startup=/usr/local/etc/rc.local.d
      </verb>

      <p>Each file ending in <tt/.sh/ will be executed in alphabetical order.

      <p>If you want to ensure a certain execution order without changing all
      the file names, you can use a scheme similar to the following with
      digits prepended to each file name to insure the ordering:

      <verb>
        10news.sh
        15httpd.sh
        20ssh.sh
      </verb>

      <p>It can be seen as ugly (or SysV :-)) but it provides a simple and
      regular scheme for locally-added packages without resorting to
      magical editing of <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt>.  Many of the ports/packages
      assume that <tt>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</tt> is a local startup directory.

      <heading>I have a new removable drive, how do I use it?</heading>

      <p>Whether it's a removable drive like a ZIP or an EZ drive (or
      even a floppy, if you want to use it that way), or a new hard
      disk, once it's installed and recognized by the system, and
      you have your cartridge/floppy/whatever slotted in, things are
      pretty much the same for all devices.

      <p><label id="disklabel">(this section is based on <url
      url="http://vinyl.quickweb.com/mark/FreeBSD/ZIP-FAQ.html"
      name="Mark Mayo's ZIP FAQ">)

      <p>If it's a ZIP drive or a floppy , you've already got a DOS
      filesystem on it, you can use a command like this:

      <verb>
        mount -t msdos /dev/fd0c /floppy
      </verb>

      <p>if it's a floppy, or this:

      <verb>
        mount -t msdos /dev/sd2s4 /zip
      </verb>

      <p>for a ZIP disk with the factory configuration.

      <p>For other disks, see how they're laid out using <tt/fdisk/ or
      <tt>/stand/sysinstall</tt>.

      <p>The rest of the examples will be for a ZIP drive on sd2, the third
      SCSI disk.

      <p>Unless it's a floppy, or a removable you plan on sharing with
      other people, it's probably a better idea to stick a BSD file
      system on it. You'll get long filename support, at least a 2X
      improvement in performance, and a lot more stability. First, you
      need to redo the DOS-level partitions/filesystems. You can either
      use <htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?fdisk"
      name="fdisk"> or <tt>/stand/sysinstall</tt>, or for a small
      drive that you don't want to bother with multiple operating system
      support on, just blow away the whole FAT partition table (slices)
      and just use the BSD partitioning:

      <verb>
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd2 count=2
        disklabel -Brw sd2 auto
      </verb>

      <p>You can use disklabel or <tt>/stand/sysinstall</tt> to create multiple
      BSD partitions. You'll certainly want to do this if you're adding
      swap space on a fixed disk, but it's probably irrelevant on a
      removable drive like a ZIP.

      <p>Finally, create a new file system, this one's on our ZIP drive
      using the whole disk:

      <verb>
        newfs /dev/rsd2c
      </verb>

      <p>and mount it:

      <verb>
        mount /dev/sd2c /zip
      </verb>

      <p>and it's probably a good idea to add a line like this to
      <htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?fstab"
      name="/etc/fstab"> so you can just type "mount /zip" in the
      future:

      <verb>
        /dev/sd2c /zip ffs rw,noauto 0 0
      </verb>

      <heading>How do I mount a secondary DOS partition?</heading>

      <p>The secondary DOS partitions are found after ALL the primary
      partitions. For example, if you have an "E" partition as the
      second DOS partition on the second SCSI drive, you need to create
      the special files for "slice 5" in /dev, then mount /dev/sd1s5:

      <verb>
        # cd /dev
        # ./MAKEDEV sd1s5
        # mount -t msdos /dev/sd1s5 /dos/e
      </verb>

      <heading>Can I mount other foreign filesystems under FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p><bf/ Digital UNIX/ UFS CDROMs can be mounted directly on FreeBSD.
      Mounting disk partitions from Digital UNIX and other systems
      that support UFS may be more complex, depending on the details
      of the disk partitioning for the operating system in question.

      <p><bf/ Linux/: 2.2 and later have support for <bf/ext2fs/ partitions.
      See <htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?mount_ext2fs"
      name="mount_ext2fs"> for more information.

      <p>Any other information on this subject would be appreciated.

    <sect1>
      <heading>How can I use the NT loader to boot FreeBSD?</heading>

      <p>The general idea is that you copy the first sector of your
      native root FreeBSD partition into a file in the DOS/NT
      partition.  Assuming you name that file something like
      <tt>c:&bsol;bootsect.bsd</tt> (inspired by <tt>c:&bsol;bootsect.dos</tt>),
      you can then edit the <tt>c:&bsol;boot.ini</tt> file to come up with
      something like this:

      <verb>
        [boot loader]
        timeout=30
        default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
        [operating systems]
        multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Windows NT"
        C:\BOOTSECT.BSD="FreeBSD"
        C:\="DOS"
      </verb>

      <p>This procedure assumes that DOS, NT, FreeBSD, or whatever
      have been installed into their respective fdisk partitions on the
      <bf/same/ disk.  In my case DOS &amp; NT are in the first fdisk
      partition and FreeBSD is in the second.  I also installed FreeBSD
      to boot from its native partition, <bf/not/ the disk MBR.

      <p>Mount a DOS-formatted floppy (if you've converted to NTFS) or the
      FAT partition, under, say, <tt>/mnt</tt>.

      <verb>
        dd if=/dev/rsd0a of=/mnt/bootsect.bsd bs=512 count=1
      </verb>

      <p>Reboot into DOS or NT.  NTFS users copy the <tt/bootsect.bsd/
      and/or the <tt/bootsect.lnx/ file from the floppy to
      <tt/C:&bsol;/.  Modify the attributes (permissions) on
      <tt/boot.ini/ with:

      <verb>
        attrib -s -r c:\boot.ini
      </verb>

      <p>Edit to add the appropriate entries from the example
      <tt/boot.ini/ above, and restore the attributes:

      <verb>
        attrib -r -s c:\boot.ini
      </verb>

      <p>If FreeBSD is booting from the MBR, restore it with the DOS
      ``<tt/fdisk/'' command after you reconfigure them to boot from their
      native partitions.

        How do I boot FreeBSD and Linux from LILO?
      </heading>

      <p>Theoretically you should be able to boot FreeBSD from LILO by
      treating it as a DOS-style operating system, but I haven't been
      able to get it to work. If you put LILO at the start of your Linux
      boot partition instead of in the MBR, you can boot LILO from the
      FreeBSD boot manager. This is what I do.

      <p>If you're running Windows-95 and Linux this is recommended anyway,
      to make it simpler to get Linux booting again if you should need
      to reinstall Windows95 (which is a Jealous Operating System, and
      will bear no other Operating Systems in the Master Boot Record).

    <sect1>
      <heading>
        Will a ``dangerously dedicated'' disk endanger my health?
      </heading>

      <p><label id="dedicate">The installation procedure allows you to chose
      two different methods in partitioning your harddisk(s).  The default way
      makes it compatible with other operating systems on the same machine,
      by using fdisk table entries (called ``slices'' in FreeBSD),
      with a FreeBSD slice that employs partitions of its own.
      Optionally, one can chose to install a boot-selector to switch
      between the possible operating systems on the disk(s).

      <p>Now, while this is certainly the common case for people
      coming from a PC background, those people coming more from a
      Unix background and who are going to setup a machine just to
      run FreeBSD and only FreeBSD, are more used to the classic
      Unix way where the operating system owns the entire disks,
      from the very first sector through the end.  A true fdisk
      table isn't of any use in this case, the machine is running
      FreeBSD 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, no other operating
      system should ever be booted on it.  So, if you select
      ``A)ll FreeBSD'' in sysinstall's fdisk editor, and answer the
      next question with ``No'', you'll get this mode.  Note that
      this means the BSD bootstrap also forms the MBR for this drive,
      so there's no space left for anything like a boot manager.
      Don't ever try to install one, or you'll damage the BSD
      bootstrap.

      <p>So why it is called ``dangerous''?  A disk in this mode
      doesn't contain what normal PC utilities would consider a
      valid fdisk table.  Depending on how well they have been
      designed, they might complain at you once they are getting
      in contact with such a disk, or even worse, they might
      damage the BSD bootstrap without even asking or notifying
      you.  Some kind of operating system that is in rather
      widespread use on PCs is known for this kind of
      user-unfriendliness (of course, it does this in the name of
      ``user-friendliness'').  At least one Award BIOS that is for
      example used in HP Netservers (but not only there) is known
      to ignore any harddisk that doesn't have what it believes to
      be a valid fdisk table.  When it comes to booting, it simply
      ignores such a disk drive, advances to the floppy drive, and
      barfs at you with just ``Read error''.  Very impressive, eh?
      They probably also call this ``user-friendly'', who knows?

      <p>The advantages of this mode are: FreeBSD owns the entire
      disk, no need to waste several fictitious `tracks' for just
      nothing but a 1980-aged simplistic partitioning model
      enforcing some artificial and now rather nonsensical
      constraints on how this partitioning needs to be done.
      These constraints often lead to what might be the biggest
      headaches for OS installations on PCs, geometry mismatch
      hassles resulting out of two different, redundant ways how
      to store the partitioning information in the fdisk table.
      See the chapter about <ref id="missing_os" name="Missing
      Operating System">.  In ``dangerously dedicated'' mode, the
      BSD bootstrap starts at sector 0, and this one is the only
      sector that always translates into the same C/H/S values,
      regardless of which `translation' your BIOS is using for
      your disk.  Thus, you can also swap disks between
      systems/controllers that use a different translation scheme,
      without risking that they won't boot anymore.

      <p>To return a ``dangerously dedicated'' disk for normal PC
      use, there are basically two options.  The first is, you
      write enough NULL bytes over the MBR to make any subsequent
      installation believe this to be a blank disk.  You can do
      this for example with

      <verb>
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd0 count=15
      </verb>

      <p>Alternatively, the undocumented DOS ``feature''

      <verb>
        fdisk /mbr
      </verb>

      <p>will to install a new master boot record as well, thus clobbering the
      BSD bootstrap.

    <sect1>
      <heading>How can I add more swap space?</heading>

      <p>The best way is to increase the size of your swap partition, or
      take advantage of this convenient excuse to add another disk.

      <p>Adding swap onto a separate disk makes things faster than
      simply adding swap onto the same disk.  As an example, if you
      are compiling source located on one disk, and the swap is on
      another disk, this is much faster than both swap and compile
      on the same disk.  This is true for SCSI disks specifically.

      <p> IDE drives are not able to allow access to both drives on
      the same channel at the same time (FreeBSD doesn't support mode 4, so
      all IDE disk I/O is ``programmed'').  I would still suggest putting
      your swap on a separate drive however.  The drives are so cheap,
      it is not worth worrying about.

      <p>It is a really bad idea to locate your swap file over NFS
      unless you are running in a very fast networking environment, with
      a good server.

      <p>Here is an example for 64Mb vn-swap (<tt>/usr/swap0</tt>, though
      of course you can use any name that you want).

      <p>Make sure your kernel was built with the line

      <verb>
        pseudo-device   vn 1   #Vnode driver (turns a file into a device)
      </verb>

      <p>in your config-file.  The GENERIC kernel already contains this.

        <verb>
          dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/swap0 bs=1024k count=64
        </verb>

        <item>enable the swap file in <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>

        <verb>
          swapfile="/usr/swap0"   # Set to name of swapfile if aux swapfile desired.
        </verb>

        <item>reboot the machine
      </enum>

      <p>To enable the swap file immediately, type

      <verb>
        vnconfig -ce /dev/vn0c /usr/swap0 swap

      <heading>What's inappropriate about my ccd?</heading>

      <p>The symptom of this is:

      <verb>
        # ccdconfig -C
        ccdconfig: ioctl (CCDIOCSET): /dev/ccd0c: Inappropriate file type or format
        #
      </verb>

      <p>This usually happens when you are trying to concatenate the
      `c' partitions, which default to type `unused'.  The ccd
      driver requires the underlying partition type to be
      FS_BSDFFS.  Edit the disklabel of the disks you are trying
      to concatenate and change the types of partitions to
      `4.2BSD'.

    <sect1>
      <heading>Why can't I edit the disklabel on my ccd?</heading>

      <p>The symptom of this is:

      <verb>
        # disklabel ccd0
        (it prints something sensible here, so let's try to edit it)
        # disklabel -e ccd0
        (edit, save, quit)
        disklabel: ioctl DIOCWDINFO: No disk label on disk;
        use "disklabel -r" to install initial label
        #
      </verb>

      <p>This is because the disklabel returned by ccd is actually a
      `fake' one that is not really on the disk.  You can solve
      this problem by writing it back explicitly, as in:

      <verb>
        # disklabel ccd0 > /tmp/disklabel.tmp
        # disklabel -Rr ccd0 /tmp/disklabel.tmp
        # disklabel -e ccd0

        How do I use sendmail for mail delivery with UUCP?<label id="uucpmail">
      </heading>

      <p>The sendmail configuration that ships with FreeBSD is
      suited for sites that connect directly to the Internet.
      Sites that wish to exchange their mail via UUCP must install
      another sendmail configuration file.

      <p>Tweaking <tt>/etc/sendmail.cf</tt> manually is considered
      something for purists.  Sendmail version 8 comes with a
      new approach of generating config files via some 
      <htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?m4"
      name="m4"> preprocessing, where the actual hand-crafted configuration
      is on a higher abstraction level.  You should use the
      configuration files under

      <verb>
        /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf
      </verb>

      <p>If you didn't install your system with full sources, the sendmail
      config stuff has been broken out into a separate source distribution
      tarball just for you.  Assuming you've got your CD-ROM mounted, do:

      <verb>
        cd /usr/src
        tar -xvzf /cdrom/dists/src/ssmailcf.aa
      </verb>

      <p>Don't panic, this is only a few hundred kilobytes in size.
      The file <tt>README</tt> in the <tt>cf</tt> directory can
      serve as a basic introduction to m4 configuration.

      <p>For UUCP delivery, you are best advised to use the
      <em>mailertable</em> feature.  This constitutes a database
      that sendmail can use to base its routing decision upon.

      <p>First, you have to create your <tt>.mc</tt> file.  The
      directory <tt>/usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf</tt> is the
      home of these files.  Look around, there are already a few
      examples.  Assuming you have named your file <tt>foo.mc</tt>,
      all you need to do in order to convert it into a valid
      <tt>sendmail.cf</tt> is:

      <verb>
        cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf
        make foo.cf
        cp foo.cf /etc/sendmail.cf
      </verb>

      <p>A typical <tt>.mc</tt> file might look like:

      <verb>
        include(`../m4/cf.m4')
        VERSIONID(`Your version number')
        OSTYPE(bsd4.4)

        FEATURE(nodns)
        FEATURE(nocanonify)
        FEATURE(mailertable)

        define(`UUCP_RELAY', your.uucp.relay)
        define(`UUCP_MAX_SIZE', 200000)

        MAILER(local)
        MAILER(smtp)
        MAILER(uucp)

        Cw    your.alias.host.name
        Cw    youruucpnodename.UUCP
      </verb>

      <p>The <em>nodns</em> and <em>nocanonify</em> features will
      prevent any usage of the DNS during mail delivery.  The
      <em>UUCP_RELAY</em> clause is needed for bizarre reasons,
      don't ask.  Simply put an Internet hostname there that
      is able to handle .UUCP pseudo-domain addresses; most likely,
      you will enter the mail relay of your ISP there.

      <p>Once you've got this, you need this file called
      <tt>/etc/mailertable</tt>.  A typical example of this
      gender again:

      <verb>
        #
        # makemap hash /etc/mailertable.db < /etc/mailertable
        #
        horus.interface-business.de   uucp-dom:horus
        .interface-business.de        uucp-dom:if-bus
        interface-business.de         uucp-dom:if-bus
        .heep.sax.de                  smtp8:%1
        horus.UUCP                    uucp-dom:horus
        if-bus.UUCP                   uucp-dom:if-bus
        .                             uucp-dom:sax
      </verb>

      <p>As you can see, this is part of a real-life file.  The first
      three lines handle special cases where domain-addressed mail
      should not be sent out to the default route, but instead to
      some UUCP neighbor in order to ``shortcut'' the delivery
      path.  The next line handles mail to the local Ethernet
      domain that can be delivered using SMTP.  Finally, the UUCP
      neighbors are mentioned in the .UUCP pseudo-domain notation,
      to allow for a ``uucp-neighbor!recipient'' override of the
      default rules.  The last line is always a single dot, matching
      everything else, with UUCP delivery to a UUCP neighbor that
      serves as your universal mail gateway to the world.  All of
      the node names behind the <tt>uucp-dom:</tt> keyword must
      be valid UUCP neighbors, as you can verify using the
      command <tt>uuname</tt>.

      <p>As a reminder that this file needs to be converted into a
      DBM database file before being usable, the command line to
      accomplish this is best placed as a comment at the top of
      the mailertable.  You always have to execute this command
      each time you change your mailertable.

      <p>Final hint: if you are uncertain whether some particular
      mail routing would work, remember the <tt>-bt</tt> option to
      sendmail.  It starts sendmail in <em>address test mode</em>;
      simply enter ``0 '', followed by the address you wish to
      test for the mail routing.  The last line tells you the used
      internal mail agent, the destination host this agent will be
      called with, and the (possibly translated) address.  Leave
      this mode by typing Control-D.

      <verb>
        j@uriah 191% sendmail -bt
        ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked)
        Enter <ruleset> <address>
        > 0 foo@interface-business.de
        rewrite: ruleset  0   input: foo @ interface-business . de
        ...
        rewrite: ruleset  0 returns: $# uucp-dom $@ if-bus $: foo \
        < @ interface-business . de >
        > ^D
        j@uriah 192%
      </verb>

        How do I set up mail with a dialup connection to the 'net?
        <label id="ispmail">
      </heading>

      <p>If you've got a statically assigned IP number, you should not
      need to adjust anything from the default.  Set your host name up
      as your assigned internet name and sendmail will do the rest.

      <p>If you've got a dynamically assigned IP number and use a dialup
      <bf/ppp/ connection to the internet, you will probably be given a
      mailbox on your ISPs mail server.  Lets assume your ISPs domain is
      <tt/myISP.com/, and that your user name is <tt/user/.  Lets also
      assume you've called your machine <tt/bsd.home/ and that your ISP
      has told you that you may use <tt/relay.myISP.com/ as a mail relay.

      <p>In order to retrieve mail from your mailbox, you'll need to
      install a retrieval agent.  <bf/Fetchmail/ is a good choice as it
      supports many different protocols.  Usually, POP3 will be provided
      by your ISP.  If you've chosen to use user-ppp, you can automatically
      fetch your mail when a connection to the 'net is established with the
      following entry in <tt>/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup</tt>:

      <verb>
        MYADDR:
          !bg su user -c fetchmail
      </verb>

      <p>I'm assuming that you have an account for <tt/user/ on <tt/bsd.home/.
      In the home directory of <tt/user/ on <tt/bsd.home/, create a
      <tt/.fetchmailrc/ file:

      <verb>
        poll myISP.com protocol pop3 fetchall pass MySecret;
      </verb>

      <p>Needless to say, this file should not be readable by anyone except
      <tt/user/ as it contains the password <tt/MySecret/.

      <p>In order to send mail with the correct <bf/from:/ header, you must
      tell sendmail to use <tt/user@myISP.com/ rather than
      <tt/user@bsd.home/.  You may also wish to tell sendmail to send all
      mail via <tt/relay.myISP.com/, allowing quicker mail transmission.

      <p>The following <tt/.mc/ file should suffice:

      <verb>
        VERSIONID(`bsd.home.mc version 1.0')
        OSTYPE(bsd4.4)dnl
        FEATURE(nouucp)dnl
        MAILER(local)dnl
        MAILER(smtp)dnl
        Cwlocalhost
        Cwbsd.home
        MASQUERADE_AS(`myISP.com')dnl
        FEATURE(allmasquerade)dnl
        FEATURE(masquerade_envelope)dnl
        FEATURE(nocanonify)dnl
        FEATURE(nodns)dnl
        define(SMART_HOST, `relay.myISP.com')
        Dmbsd.home
        define(`confDOMAIN_NAME',`bsd.home')dnl
        define(`confDELIVERY_MODE',`deferred')dnl
      </verb>

      <p>Refer to the previous section for details of how to turn this
      <tt/.mc/ file into a <tt/sendmail.cf/ file.  Also, don't forget to
      restart sendmail after updating sendmail.cf.

   <sect1>
    <heading>Eek! I forgot the root password!</heading>

    <p>Don't Panic!  Simply restart the system, type -s at the Boot: prompt
    to enter Single User mode.  At the question about the shell to use,
    hit ENTER.  You'll be dropped to a # prompt.  Enter <tt>mount -u /</tt> to
    remount your root filesystem read/write, then run <tt/passwd root/ to 
    change the root password.  Run <tt/mount -a/ then <tt/exit/
    to continue booting.

   <heading>How do I keep Control-Alt-Delete from rebooting the system?
   </heading>

    <p>Edit the keymap you are using for the console and replace the 
    <tt/rbt/ keywords with <tt/nop/.  The default keymap is 
    <tt>/usr/share/syscons/keymaps/us.iso.kbd</tt>.  You may have to instruct
    <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt> to load this keymap explicitly for the change to
    take effect.  Of course if you are using an alternate keymap for your
    country, you should edit that one instead.
