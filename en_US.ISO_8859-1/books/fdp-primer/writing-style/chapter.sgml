<chapter id="writing-style">
  <title>Writing style</title>
  
  <para>In order to promote consistency between the myriad authors of the
    FreeBSD documentation, some guidelines have been drawn up for authors to
    follow.</para>
  
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Do not use contractions</term>
      
      <listitem>
	<para>Do not use contractions.  Always spell the phrase out in full.
	  &ldquo;Don't use contractions&rdquo; would be wrong.</para>

	<para>Avoiding contractions makes for a more formal tone, is more
	  precise, and slightly easier for translators.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Use the serial comma</term>
      
      <listitem>
	<para>In a list of items within a paragraph, seperate each item from
	  the others with a comma.  Seperate the last item from the others with
	  a comma and the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</para>

	<para>For example, look at the following quote;</para>
	
	<blockquote>
	  <para>This is a list of one, two and three items.</para>
	</blockquote>
	
	<para>Is this a list of three items, &ldquo;one&rdquo;,
	  &ldquo;two&rdquo;, and &ldquo;three&rdquo;, or a list of two items,
	  &ldquo;one&rdquo; and &ldquo;two and three&rdquo;?</para>
	
	<para>It is better to be explicit and include a serial comma;</para>
	
	<blockquote>
	  <para>This is a list of one, two, and three items.</para>
	</blockquote>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Avoid redundant phrases</term>
      
      <listitem>
	<para>Try not to use redundant phrases.  In particular, &ldquo;the
	  command&rdquo;, &ldquo;the file&rdquo;, and &ldquo;man
	  command&rdquo; are probably redundant.</para>

	<para>These two examples show this for commands.  The second example
	  is preferred.</para>
	
	<informalexample>
	  <para>Use the command <command>cvsup</command> to update your
	    sources</para>
	</informalexample>
      
	<informalexample>
	  <para>Use <command>cvsup</command> to update your sources</para>
	</informalexample>
	
	<para>These two examples show this for filenames.  The second example
	  is preferred.</para>
	
	<informalexample>
	  <para>&hellip; in the filename
	    <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename>&hellip;</para>
	</informalexample>
	
	<informalexample>
	  <para>&hellip; in
	    <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename>&hellip;</para>
	</informalexample>
	
	<para>These two examples show this for manual references.  The second
	  example is preferred (the second example uses
	  <sgmltag>citerefentry</sgmltag>).</para>
	
	<informalexample>
	  <para>See <command>man csh</command> for more
	    information.</para>
	</informalexample>
	
	<informalexample>
	  <para>See &man.csh.1;</para>
	</informalexample>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>For more information about writing style, see <ulink
      url="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/strunk/">Elements of
      Style</ulink>, by William Strunk.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Style guide</title>

    <para>To keep the source for the Handbook consistent when many different
      people are editing it, please follow these style conventions.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Letter case</title>

      <para>Tags are entered in lower case, <literal>&lt;para&gt;</literal>,
	<emphasis>not</emphasis> <literal>&lt;PARA&gt;</literal>.</para>

      <para>Text that appears in SGML contexts is generally written in upper
	case, <literal>&lt!ENTITY&hellip;&gt;</literal>, and
	<literal>&lt;!DOCTYPE&hellip;&gt;</literal>, <emphasis>not</emphasis>
	<literal>&lt;!entity&hellip;&gt;</literal> and
	<literal>&lt;!doctype&hellip;&gt;</literal>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Indentation</title>

      <para>Each file starts with indentation set at column 0,
	<emphasis>regardless</emphasis> of the indentation level of the file
	which might contain this one.</para>

      <para>Every start tag increases the indentation level by 2 spaces, and
	every end tag decreases the indentation level by 2 spaces.  Content
	within elements should be indented by two spaces if the content runs
	over more than one line.</para>

      <para>For example, the source for this section looks something
	like;</para>

      <programlisting>
<![ CDATA [+--- This is column 0
V
<chapter>
  <title>...</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>...</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Indentation</title>

      <para>Each file starts with indentation set at column 0,
        <emphasis>regardless</emphasis> of the indentation level of the file
        which might contain this one.</para>

      <para>Every start tag increases the indentation level by 2 spaces, and
        every end tag decreases the indentation level by 2 spaces.  Content
        within elements should be indented by two spaces if the content runs
        over more than one line.</para>

      ...	
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
</chapter>]]></programlisting>

      <para>If you use <application>Emacs</application> or
	<application>Xemacs</application> to edit the files then
	<literal>sgml-mode</literal> should be loaded automatically, and the
	Emacs local variables at the bottom of each file should enforce these
	styles.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>White space changes</title>

      <para>When committing changes, <emphasis>do not commit changes to the
	  content at the same time as changes to the
	  formatting</emphasis>.</para>
      
      <para>This is so that the teams that convert the Handbook to other
	languages can quickly see what content has actually changed in your
	commit, without having to decide whether a line has changed because of
	the content, or just because it has been refilled.</para>

      <para>For example, if you have added two sentances to a paragraph, such
	that the line lengths on the paragraph now go over 80 columns, first
	commit your change with the too-long line lengths.  Then fix the line
	wrapping, and commit this second change.  In the commit message for
	the second change, be sure to indicate that this is a whitespace-only
	change, and that the translation team can ignore it.</para>
