    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>One of the most frustrating experiences one can have as a
      software user is to submit a problem report only to have it
      summarily closed with a terse and unhelpful explanation like
      <quote>not a bug</quote> or <quote>bogus PR</quote>.  Similarly,
      one of the most frustrating experiences as a software developer
      is to be flooded with problem reports that are not really
      problem reports but requests for support, or that contain little
      or no information about what the problem is and how to reproduce
      it.</para>

    <para>This document attempts to describe how to write good problem
      reports.  What, you ask, is a good problem report?  Well, to go
      straight to the bottom line, a good problem report is one that
      can be analyzed and dealt with swiftly, to the mutual
      satisfaction of both user and developer.</para>

    <para>Although the primary focus of this article is on &os;
      problem reports, most of it should apply quite well to other
      software projects.</para>

    <para>Note that this article is organized thematically, not
      chronologically, so you should read through the entire document
      before submitting a problem report, rather than treat it as a
      step-by-step tutorial.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="pr-when">
    <title>When to submit a problem report</title>

    <para>There are many types of problems, and not all of them should
      engender a problem report.  Of course, nobody is perfect, and
      there will be times when you are convinced you have found a bug
      in a program when in fact you have misunderstood the syntax for
      a command or made a typographical error in a configuration file
      (though that in
      itself may sometimes be indicative of poor documentation or poor
      error handling in the application).  There are still many cases
      where submitting a problem report is clearly
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> the right
      course of action, and will only serve to frustrate you and the
      developers.  Conversely, there are cases where it might be
      appropriate to submit a problem report about something else than
      a bug&mdash;an enhancement or a feature request, for
      instance.</para>

    <para>So how do you determine what is a bug and what is not?  As a
      simple rule of thumb your problem is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a
      bug if it can be expressed as a question (usually of the form
      <quote>How do I do X?</quote> or <quote>Where can I find
      Y?</quote>).  It is not always quite so black and white, but the
      question rule covers a large majority of cases.  If you are looking
      for an answer, consider posing your question to the
      &a.questions;.</para>

    <para>Some cases where it may be appropriate to submit a problem
      report about something that is not a bug are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Requests for feature enhancements.  It is generally a
	  good idea to air these on the mailing lists before
	  submitting a problem report.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Notification of updates to externally maintained
	  software (mainly ports, but also externally maintained base
	  system components such as BIND or various GNU
	  utilities).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Another thing is that if the system on which you experienced
      the bug is not fairly up-to-date, you should seriously consider
      upgrading and trying to reproduce the problem on an up-to-date
      system before submitting a problem report.  There are few things
      that will annoy a developer more than receiving a problem report
      about a bug she has already fixed.</para>

    <para>Finally, a bug that can not be reproduced can rarely be
      fixed.  If the bug only occurred once and you can not reproduce
      it, and it does not seem to happen to anybody else, chances are
      none of the developers will be able to reproduce it or figure
      out what is wrong.  That does not mean it did not happen, but it
      does mean that the chances of your problem report ever leading
      to a bug fix are very slim.  To make matters worse, often
      these kinds of bugs are actually caused by failing hard drives
      or overheating processors &mdash; you should always try to rule
      out these causes, whenever possible, before submitting a PR.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="pr-prep">
    <title>Preparations</title>

    <para>A good rule to follow is to always do a background search
      before submitting a problem report.  Maybe your problem has
      already been reported; maybe it is being discussed on the
      mailing lists, or recently was; it may even already be fixed in
      a newer version than what you are running.  You should therefore
      check all the obvious places before submitting your problem
      report.  For &os;, this means:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The &os;
	  <ulink url="&url.books.faq;/index.html">Frequently Asked
	    Questions</ulink> (FAQ) list.
	  The FAQ attempts to provide answers for a wide range of questions,
	  such as those concerning
	  <ulink url="&url.books.faq;/hardware.html">hardware
	    compatibility</ulink>,
	  <ulink url="&url.books.faq;/applications.html">user
	    applications</ulink>,
	  and <ulink url="&url.books.faq;/kernelconfig.html">kernel
	    configuration</ulink>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>The
	  <ulink
	    url="&url.books.handbook;/eresources.html#ERESOURCES-MAIL">mailing
	    lists</ulink>&mdash;if you are not subscribed, use
	  <ulink
	    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html#mailinglists">the
	    searchable archives</ulink> on the &os; web site.  If your
	  problem has not been discussed on the lists, you might try
	  posting a message about it and waiting a few days to see if
	  someone can spot something you have overlooked.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Optionally, the entire web&mdash;use your favorite
	  search engine to locate any references to your problem.  You
	  may even get hits from archived mailing lists or newsgroups
	  you did not know of or had not thought to search
	  through.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Next, the searchable
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query">
	  &os; PR database</ulink> (GNATS).  Unless your problem
	  is recent or obscure, there is a fair chance it has already
	  been reported.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Most importantly, you should attempt to see if existing
	  documentation in the source base addresses your problem.</para>

	<para>For the base &os; code, you should
	  carefully study the contents of the
	  <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> file on your system
	  or its latest version at
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/UPDATING"></ulink>.
	  (This is vital information
	  if you are upgrading from one version to
	  another&mdash;especially if you are upgrading to the
	  &os.current; branch).</para>

	<para>However, if the problem is in something that was installed
	  as a part of the &os; Ports Collection, you should refer to
	  <filename>/usr/ports/UPDATING</filename> (for individual ports)
	  or <filename>/usr/ports/CHANGES</filename> (for changes
	  that affect the entire Ports Collection).
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/UPDATING"></ulink>
	  and
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/CHANGES"></ulink>
	  are also available via CVSweb.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Next, you need to make sure your problem report goes to the
      right people.</para>

    <para>The first catch here is that if the problem is a bug in
      third-party software (a port or a package you have installed), you
      should report the bug to the original author, not to the &os;
      Project.  There are two exceptions to this rule: the first is if
      the bug does not occur on other platforms, in which case the
      problem may lie in how the software was ported to &os;; the
      second is if the original author has already fixed the bug and
      released a patch or a new version of his software, and the
      &os; port has not been updated yet.</para>

    <para>The second catch is that &os;'s bug tracking system sorts
      problem reports according to the category the originator
      selected.  Therefore, if you select the wrong category when you
      submit your problem report, there is a good chance that it will
      go unnoticed for a while, until someone re-categorizes it.</para>

  <section id="pr-writing">
    <title>Writing the problem report</title>

    <para>Now that you have decided that your issue merits a problem
      report, and that it is a &os; problem, it is time to write
      the actual problem report.  Before we get into the mechanics
      of the program used to generate and submit PRs, here are some
      tips and tricks to help make sure that your PR will be most
      effective.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Tips and tricks for writing a good problem report</title>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Do not leave the <quote>Synopsis</quote>
	    line empty.</emphasis>  The PRs go both onto a mailing list
	    that goes all over the world (where the <quote>Synopsis</quote>
	    is used
	    for the <literal>Subject:</literal> line), but also into a
	    database.  Anyone who comes along later and browses the
	    database by synopsis, and finds a PR with a blank subject
	    line, tends just to skip over it.  Remember that PRs stay
	    in this database until they are closed by someone; an
	    anonymous one will usually just disappear in the
	    noise.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Avoid using a weak <quote>Synopsis</quote>
	    line.</emphasis>  You should not assume that anyone reading
	    your PR has any context for your submission, so the more
	    you provide, the better.  For instance, what part of the
	    system does the problem apply to?  Do you only see the
	    problem while installing, or while running?  To
	    illustrate, instead of <literal>Synopsis: portupgrade is
	    broken</literal>, see how much more informative this
	    seems: <literal>Synopsis: port sysutils/portupgrade
	    coredumps on -current</literal>.  (In the case of ports,
	    it is especially helpful to have both the category and
	    portname in the <quote>Synopsis</quote> line.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>If you have a patch, say so.</emphasis>
	    A PR with a patch included is much more likely to be
	    looked at than one without.  If you are including one,
	    put the string <literal>[patch]</literal> at the
	    beginning of the <quote>Synopsis</quote>.  (Although it is
	    not mandatory to use that exact string, by convention,
	    that is the one that is used.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>If you are a maintainer, say so.</emphasis>
	    If you are maintaining a part of the source code (for
	    instance, a port), you might consider adding the string
	    <literal>[maintainer update]</literal> at the beginning of
	    your synopsis line, and you definitely should set the
	    <quote>Class</quote> of
	    your PR to <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.  This way
	    any committer that handles your PR will not have to check.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Be specific.</emphasis>
	    The more information you supply about what problem you
	    are having, the better your chance of getting a response.</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Include the version of &os; you are running (there
		is a place to put that, see below) and on which architecture.
		You should include whether you are running from a release
		(e.g. from a CDROM or download), or from
		a system maintained by &man.cvsup.1; (and, if so, how
		recently you updated).  If you are tracking the
		&os.current; branch, that is the very first thing someone
		will ask, because fixes (especially for high-profile
		problems) tend to get committed very quickly, and
		&os.current; users are expected to keep up.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Include which global options you have specified in
		your <filename>make.conf</filename>.  Note: specifying
		<literal>-O2</literal> and above to &man.gcc.1; is
		known to be buggy in many situations.  While the
		&os; developers will accept patches, they are
		generally unwilling to investigate such issues due
		to simple lack of time and volunteers, and may
		instead respond that this just is not supported.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If this is a kernel problem, then be prepared to
		supply the following information.  (You do not
		have to include these by default, which only tends to
		fill up the database, but you should include excerpts
		that you think might be relevant):</para>

	      <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>your kernel configuration (including which
		    hardware devices you have installed)</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>whether or not you have debugging options enabled
		    (such as <literal>WITNESS</literal>), and if so,
		    whether the problem persists when you change the
		    sense of that option</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>a backtrace, if one was generated</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>the fact that you have read
		    <filename>src/UPDATING</filename> and that your problem
		    is not listed there (someone is guaranteed to ask)</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>whether or not you can run any other kernel as
		    a fallback (this is to rule out hardware-related
		    issues such as failing disks and overheating CPUs,
		    which can masquerade as kernel problems)</para>
		</listitem>
	      </itemizedlist>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If this is a ports problem, then be prepared to
		supply the following information.  (You do not
		have to include these by default, which only tends to
		fill up the database, but you should include excerpts
		that you think might be relevant):</para>

	      <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>which ports you have installed</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>any environment variables that override the
		    defaults in <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>, such
		    as <makevar>PORTSDIR</makevar></para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>the fact that you have read

	      </itemizedlist>
	    </listitem>

	  </itemizedlist>

	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Avoid vague requests for features.</emphasis>
	    PRs of the form <quote>someone should really implement something
	    that does so-and-so</quote> are less likely to get results than
	    very specific requests.  Remember, the source is available
	    to everyone, so if you want a feature, the best way to
	    ensure it being included is to get to work!  Also consider
	    the fact that many things like this would make a better
	    topic for discussion on <literal>freebsd-questions</literal>
	    than an entry in the PR database, as discussed above.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Make sure no one else has already submitted
	    a similar PR.</emphasis> Although this has already been
	    mentioned above, it bears repeating here.  It only take a
	    minute or two to use the web-based search engine at
	    <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query"></ulink>.
	    (Of course, everyone is guilty of forgetting to do this
	    now and then.)</para> </listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Avoid controversial requests.</emphasis>
	    If your PR addresses an area that has been controversial
	    in the past, you should probably be prepared to not only
	    offer patches, but also justification for why the patches
	    are <quote>The Right Thing To Do</quote>.  As noted above,
	    a careful search of the mailing lists using the archives
	    at <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html#mailinglists"></ulink>
	    is always good preparation.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Be polite.</emphasis>
	    Almost anyone who would potentially work on your PR is a
	    volunteer.  No one likes to be told that they have to do
	    something when they are already doing it for some
	    motivation other than monetary gain.  This is a good thing
	    to keep in mind at all times on Open Source
	    projects.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Before you begin</title>

      <para>Before running the &man.send-pr.1; program, make sure your
	<envar>VISUAL</envar> (or <envar>EDITOR</envar> if
	<envar>VISUAL</envar> is not set) environment variable is set
	to something sensible.</para>

      <para>You should also make sure that mail delivery works fine.
	&man.send-pr.1; uses mail messages for the submission and
	tracking of problem reports.  If you cannot post mail messages
	from the machine you're running &man.send-pr.1; on, your
	problem report will not reach the GNATS database.  For details
	on the setup of mail on &os;, see the <quote>Electronic
	Mail</quote> chapter of the &os; Handbook at
	<ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mail.html"></ulink>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Attaching patches or files</title>

      <para>The &man.send-pr.1; program has provisions for attaching
	files to a problem report.  You can attach as many files as
	you want provided that each has a unique base name (i.e. the
	name of the file proper, without the path).  Just use the
	<option>-a</option> command-line option to specify the names
	of the files you wish to attach:</para>

<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>send-pr -a /var/run/dmesg -a /tmp/errors</userinput></screen>

      <para>Do not worry about binary files, they will be automatically
	encoded so as not to upset your mail agent.</para>

      <para>If you attach a patch, make sure you use the
	<option>-c</option> or <option>-u</option> option to
	&man.diff.1; to create a context or unified diff (unified is
	preferred), and make
	sure to specify the exact CVS revision numbers of the files
	you modified so the developers who read your report will be
	able to apply them easily.  For problems with the kernel or the
	base utilities, a patch against &os.current; (the HEAD
	CVS branch) is preferred since all new code should be applied
	and tested there first.  After appropriate or substantial testing
	has been done, the code will be merged/migrated to the &os.stable;
	branch.</para>

      <para>If you attach a patch inline, instead of as an attachment,
	note that the most common problem by far is the tendency of some
	email programs to render tabs as spaces, which will completely
	ruin anything intended to be part of a Makefile.</para>

      <para>Also note that while including small patches in a PR is
	generally all right&mdash;particularly when they fix the problem
	described in the PR&mdash;large patches and especially new code
	which may require substantial review before committing should
	be placed on a web or ftp server, and the URL should be
	included in the PR instead of the patch.  Patches in email
	tend to get mangled, especially when GNATS is involved, and
	the larger the patch, the harder it will be for interested
	parties to unmangle it.  Also, posting a patch on the web
	allows you to modify it without having to resubmit the entire
	patch in a followup to the original PR.</para>

      <para>You should also take note that unless you explicitly
	specify otherwise in your PR or in the patch itself, any
	patches you submit will be assumed to be licensed under the
	same terms as the original file you modified.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Filling out the template</title>

      <para>When you run &man.send-pr.1;, you are presented with a
	template.  The template consists of a list of fields, some of
	which are pre-filled, and some of which have comments explaining
	their purpose or listing acceptable values.  Do not worry
	about the comments; they will be removed automatically if you
	do not modify them or remove them yourself.</para>

      <para>At the top of the template, below the
	<literal>SEND-PR:</literal> lines, are the email headers.  You
	do not normally need to modify these, unless you are sending
	the problem report from a machine or account that can send but
	not receive mail, in which case you will want to set the
	<literal>From:</literal> and <literal>Reply-To:</literal> to
	your real email address.  You may also want to send yourself
	(or someone else) a carbon copy of the problem report by
	adding one or more email addresses to the
	<literal>Cc:</literal> header.</para>

      <para>Next comes a series of single-line fields:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Submitter-Id:</emphasis> Do not change this.
	    The default value of <literal>current-users</literal> is
	    correct, even if you run &os.stable;.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Originator:</emphasis> This is normally
	    prefilled with the <literal>gecos</literal> field of the
	    currently logged-in
	    user.  Please specify your real name, optionally followed
	    by your email address in angle brackets.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Organization:</emphasis> Whatever you feel
	    like.  This field is not used for anything
	    significant.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Confidential:</emphasis> This is prefilled
	    to <literal>no</literal>.   Changing it makes no sense as
	    there is no such thing as a confidential &os; problem
	    report&mdash;the PR database is distributed worldwide by
	    <application>CVSup</application>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Synopsis:</emphasis> Fill this out with a
	    short and accurate description of the problem.  The
	    synopsis is used as the subject of the problem report
	    email, and is used in problem report listings and
	    summaries; problem reports with obscure synopses tend to
	    get ignored.</para>

	  <para>As noted above, if your problem report includes a patch,
	    please have the synopsis start with <literal>[patch]</literal>;
	    if you are a maintainer, you may consider adding
	    <literal>[maintainer update]</literal> and set the
	    <quote>Class</quote> of your PR to
	    <literal>maintainer-update</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Severity:</emphasis> One of
	    <literal>non-critical</literal>,
	    <literal>serious</literal> or
	    <literal>critical</literal>.  Do not overreact; refrain
	    from labeling your problem <literal>critical</literal>
	    unless it really is (e.g. <username>root</username> exploit, easily
	    reproducible panic) or <literal>serious</literal> unless

	    developer understand the cause for the problem), but if
	    you do not have any firm ideas for either, it is better to
	    leave this field blank than to speculate.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Sending off the problem report</title>

      <para>Once you are done filling out the template, have saved it,
	and exit your editor, &man.send-pr.1; will prompt you with
	<prompt>s)end, e)dit or a)bort?</prompt>.  You can then hit
	<userinput>s</userinput> to go ahead and submit the problem report,
	<userinput>e</userinput> to restart the editor and make
	further modifications, or <userinput>a</userinput> to abort.
	If you choose the latter, your problem report will remain on
	disk (&man.send-pr.1; will tell you the filename before it
	terminates), so you can edit it at your leisure, or maybe
	transfer it to a system with better net connectivity, before
	sending it with the <option>-f</option> to
	&man.send-pr.1;:</para>

<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>send-pr -f ~/my-problem-report</userinput></screen>

      <para>This will read the specified file, validate the contents,
	strip comments and send it off.</para>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section id="pr-followup">
    <title>Follow-up</title>

    <para>Once your problem report has been filed, you will receive a
      confirmation by email which will include the tracking number
      that was assigned to your problem report and a URL you can use
      to check its status.  With a little luck, someone will take an
      interest in your problem and try to address it, or, as the case
      may be, explain why it is not a problem.  You will be
      automatically notified of any change of status, and you will
      receive copies of any comments or patches someone may attach to
      your problem report's audit trail.</para>

    <para>If someone requests additional information from you, or you
      remember or discover something you did not mention in the
      initial report, please use one of two methods to submit your
      followup:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The easiest way is to use the followup link on
	  the individual PR's web page, which you can reach from the
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query">
	  PR search page</ulink>.  Clicking on this link will bring up an
	  an email window with the correct To: and Subject: lines filled in
	  (if your browser is configured to do this).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Alternatively, you can just mail it to
	  <email>bug-followup@FreeBSD.org</email>, making sure that the
	  tracking number is included in the subject so the bug tracking
	  system will know what problem report to attach it to.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>If you do <emphasis>not</emphasis> include the tracking
	    number, GNATS will become confused and create an entirely
	    new PR which it then assigns to the GNATS administrator,
	    and then your followup will become lost until someone
	    comes in to clean up the mess, which could be days or
	    weeks afterwards.</para>

	  <para>Wrong way: <programlisting>Subject: that PR I sent</programlisting>
	    Right way: <programlisting>Subject: Re: ports/12345: compilation problem with foo/bar</programlisting></para>
	</note>
      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If the problem report remains open after the problem has
      gone away, just send a follow-up (in the manner prescribed
      above) saying that the problem report can be closed, and, if
      possible, explaining how or when the problem was fixed.</para>
