  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>Welcome to the &os; Documentation Project (<acronym>FDP</acronym>).  Quality
    documentation is very important to the success of &os;.  Your contributions are very
    valuable.</para>

  <para>This document's main purpose is to explain
    how the <acronym>FDP</acronym> is organized, how to
    write and submit documentation, and
    how to effectively use the available tools.</para>

  <para>Everyone is welcome to contribute to the <acronym>FDP</acronym>.  There is no membership requirement or minimum quota of
    documentation that needs to be produced.</para>

  <para>After you have finished reading this document you
    will be able to:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Identify which parts of &os; are maintained by the <acronym>FDP</acronym>.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Install the required tools and files.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Make changes to the documentation.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Submit changes back for review and

  <sect1 id="overview-doc">
    <title>The &os; Documentation Set</title>

    <para>The <acronym>FDP</acronym> is responsible for four categories of &os;
      documentation.</para>

    <itemizedlist>

       <listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Handbook</emphasis>: The Handbook is the comprehensive online
	    resource and reference for &os; users.</para>
      </listitem>
     

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>FAQ</emphasis>: The <acronym>FAQ</acronym> uses a short question and answer
	  format to address questions that are frequently asked on
	  the various mailing lists and forums devoted to
	  &os;.  This format does not permit long and
	  comprehensive answers.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Manual pages</emphasis>: The English language system manual pages are usually not
	  written by the <acronym>FDP</acronym>, as they are part of the base system.
	  However, the <acronym>FDP</acronym> can reword parts of existing
	  manual pages to make them clearer or to correct
	  inaccuracies.</para>
      </listitem>      

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Web site</emphasis>: This is the main &os; presence on the
	  web, visible at <ulink
	    url="http://www.freebsd.org/index.html">http://www.FreeBSD.org/</ulink>
	  and many mirrors around the world.  The web site is typically
	  a new user's first exposure to &os;.</para>
       </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Translation teams are responsible for translating
      the Handbook and web site into different languages.  Manual pages are not translated.</para>
	    
    <para>Documentation source for the &os; web site, Handbook, and <acronym>FAQ</acronym>
      is available in the Subversion
      repository at
      <literal>https://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/</literal>.</para>

    <para>Source for manual pages is available in a separate
      Subversion repository located at
      <literal>https://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/</literal>.</para>

    <para>The commit messages to the <acronym>FDP</acronym>
      are visible to anyone using
      <application>svn</application>. They are also archived at
      &a.svn-doc-all.url;.</para>

    <para>In addition, many people have written tutorials or how-to
      articles about &os;.  Some are stored in the
      <acronym>FDP</acronym>.  In other
      cases, the author has decided to keep the documentation separate
      from the <acronym>FDP</acronym>.  The
      <acronym>FDP</acronym> endeavors to provide links to as much of this documentation
      as possible.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="overview-quick-start">
    <title>Quick Start</title>

    <para>This section outlines the steps which new contributors need
      to follow before they can make changes to the <acronym>FDP</acronym>.  New contributors
      will interact with other members of
      the &os; Documentation Team which can assist in learning
      how to use <acronym>XML</acronym> and the <xref
	linkend="writing-style-guide"/>.  If
      a new user contributes regularly, a Documentation Team member may be
      assigned as a mentor to guide the user through the process from
      contributor to documentation committer.</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>
	Subscribe to the &a.doc;.  Some members of the mailing
	  list also interact on the <literal>#bsddocs</literal> <acronym>IRC</acronym>
	  channel on <ulink
	    url="http://www.efnet.org/">EFnet</ulink>.</para>
       </step>

       <step>
	<para>Install the
	  <filename role="package">textproc/docproj</filename>
	  package or port.  This meta-port
	  installs all of the utilities needed by the <acronym>FDP</acronym>.</para>
       </step>

      <step>
	<para>Install a local working copy of the documentation
	  from a mirror of the &os; repository.  For the fastest
	  download, pick the nearest mirror from the list of <ulink
	    url="&url.books.handbook;#svn-mirrors">Subversion mirror sites</ulink>.
	  If <filename role="directory">/usr/doc</filename> already
          exists, move or delete it first to prevent file
          conflicts.</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn checkout https://<replaceable>svn0.us-west.FreeBSD.org</replaceable>/doc/head <replaceable>/usr/doc</replaceable></userinput></screen>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Before making any documentation edits, configure your
	    editor to conform to <acronym>FDP</acronym> standards.  How to do so varies
	    by editor.  Some editor configurations are listed in <xref
	      linkend="writing-style"/>. The editor
	    should be configured as follows:</para>
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Word wrap set to 70 characters.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Tab stops set to 2.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Replace each group of 8 leading spaces with a
		single tab.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Determine which file to edit.  Run <command>svn up</command> within the
	    local working copy to make sure that it is
	    current.  Before making major
	    changes to a file, discuss the proposed changes first with
	    the &a.doc;.</para>

	<para>When making edits, determine which
	    tags and entities are needed to achieve the desired
	    formatting.  One way to learn is to compare some text in
	    the <acronym>HTML</acronym> formatted version of the document to the tags
	    which surround the text or the entities that represent
	    that text in the <acronym>XML</acronym> file.  A
	    reference to the commonly used tags and entities can be
	    found in <xref linkend="xml-markup"/>.</para>
	</step>

	  <step>
	    <para>Once the edits are complete, check for problems by running:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>igor -R filename.xml | less -RS</userinput></screen>

	  <para>While reviewing the output, edit the file to fix the
	    listed tab errors, spelling mistakes, and improper
	    grammar.  Save the changes and rerun this command to find
	    any remaining problems.  Repeat until all of the errors that
	    you deem fixable are resolved.  If you get stuck trying to
	    fix errors, ask for assistance on the &a.doc;.</para>
	</step>

      <step>
	<para><emphasis>Always</emphasis> build-test changes before submitting them.  By
	    default, typing <userinput>make</userinput> in the
	    top-level directory of the type of documentation being
	    edited will generate that documentation in
	    split HTML format.  For example, to build the English
	    version of the Handbook, type <userinput>make</userinput>
	    in the
	    <filename>en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/</filename>
	    directory.  This step is necessary to make sure that the
	    edits do not break the build.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>In order to build the output in other formats,
	    other <application>make</application> targets are defined
	    in <filename>head/share/mk/doc.docbook.mk</filename>.
	    Use quotes around the list of formats when
	    building more than one format with a single
	    command.</para>

	<para>For example, to convert the document to both
	    <literal>.html</literal> and <literal>.txt</literal>, use
	    this command:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>make FORMATS="html txt"</userinput></screen>

	<para>Once these steps are successfully completed,
	    generate a <quote>diff file</quote> of the changes.  While in
	    <filename class="directory">/usr/doc</filename>, run this
	    command, replacing <replaceable>bsdinstall</replaceable>
	    with the name of the directory containing the edits:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svn diff > <replaceable>bsdinstall</replaceable>.diff.txt</userinput></screen>
	</step>

      <step>
	<para>Submit the diff file using the web-based <ulink
	      url="&url.base;/support.html#gnats">Problem Report</ulink>
	    system or with &man.send-pr.1;.  If using the web form,
	    input a synopsis of <emphasis>[patch] <replaceable>short description of problem</replaceable></emphasis>.
	    Select the category <literal>docs</literal> and the
	    class <literal>doc-bug</literal>.  The body of the
	    message should contain a short description of the edits
	      and any important discussion points.  Use the <guibutton>[&nbsp;Browse...&nbsp;]</guibutton> button to attach the
	    <literal>.diff.txt</literal> file and enter the captcha
	    phrase.</para>

	<para>It is important to remember that the <acronym>FDP</acronym>
	    is comprised of volunteers who review
	    edits in their spare time and who live in different time
	    zones across the globe.  It takes time to review edits and
	    to either commit them or respond if additional edits are
	    required.  If you do not receive a response in a reasonable
	    amount of time, send a follow-up email to the &a.doc; and ask if anyone
	    has had a chance to review the patch or if additional
	    information is required.</para>
