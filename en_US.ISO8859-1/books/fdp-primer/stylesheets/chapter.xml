  <title>Stylesheets</title>

  <para>XML says nothing about how a document should be displayed to
    the user, or rendered on paper.  To do that, various languages
    have been developed to describe stylesheets, including XSLT, XSL FO
    or CSS.</para>

  <para>We use XSLT stylesheets to transform DocBook into XHTML and then
    we apply CSS formatting to XHTML pages.  Currently, the printable
    output is rendered with legacy DSSSL stylesheets but this may
    probably change in the future.</para>

  <sect1 id="stylesheets-css">
    <title>CSS</title>

    <para>Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) are a mechanism for attaching
      style information (font, weight, size, color, and so forth) to
      elements in an XHTML document without abusing XHTML to do
      so.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>The DocBook Documents</title>

      <para>The FreeBSD DSSSL stylesheets include a reference to a
	stylesheet, <filename>docbook.css</filename>, which is
	expected to appear in the same directory as the XHTML files.
	The project-wide CSS file is copied from
	<filename>doc/share/misc/docbook.css</filename> when documents
	are converted to XHTML, and is installed automatically.</para>
