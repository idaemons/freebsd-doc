  <para>This book is the combined work of hundreds of contributors of
    "The FreeBSD Documentation Project".  The text is authored in SGML
    according to the DocBook DTD and is formatted from SGML into many
    different presentation formats using Jade, an open source DSSSL
    engine.  Norm Walsh's DSSSL stylesheets were used with an
    additional customization layer to provide the presentation
    instructions for Jade.</para>
