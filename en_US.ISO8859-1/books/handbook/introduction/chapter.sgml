	<para>FreeBSD is a state of the art operating system for personal
	  computers based on the Intel CPU architecture, which includes the
	  386, 486 and Pentium processors (both SX and DX versions). Intel
	  compatible CPUs from AMD and Cyrix are supported as well. FreeBSD
	  provides you with many advanced features previously available only
	  on much more expensive computers. These features include:</para>

	<para>FreeBSD is based on the 4.4BSD-Lite release from Computer
	  Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California at
	  Berkeley, and carries on the distinguished tradition of BSD systems
	  development. In addition to the fine work provided by CSRG, the
	  FreeBSD Project has put in many thousands of hours in fine tuning
	  the system for maximum performance and reliability in real-life load
	  situations. As many of the commercial giants struggle to field PC
	  operating systems with such features, performance and reliability,
	  FreeBSD can offer them <emphasis>now</emphasis>!</para>
	
	<para>The applications to which FreeBSD can be put are truly limited
	  only by your own imagination. From software development to factory
	  automation, inventory control to azimuth correction of remote
	  satellite antennae; if it can be done with a commercial UNIX product
	  then it is more than likely that you can do it with FreeBSD, too!
	  FreeBSD also benefits significantly from the literally thousands of
	  high quality applications developed by research centers and
	  universities around the world, often available at little to no cost.
	  Commercial applications are also available and appearing in greater
	  numbers every day.</para>
	
	<para>Because the source code for FreeBSD itself is generally
	  available, the system can also be customized to an almost unheard of
	  degree for special applications or projects, and in ways not
	  generally possible with operating systems from most major commercial
	  vendors. Here is just a sampling of some of the applications in
	  which people are currently using FreeBSD:</para>

	<title>A Brief History of FreeBSD</title>
	
	<para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.jkh;</emphasis>.</para>
	
	<para>The FreeBSD project had its genesis in the early part of 1993,
	  partially as an outgrowth of the &ldquo;Unofficial 386BSD Patchkit&rdquo; by the
	  patchkit's last 3 coordinators: Nate Williams, Rod Grimes and
	  myself.</para>
	
	<para>Our original goal was to produce an intermediate snapshot of
	  386BSD in order to fix a number of problems with it that the
	  patchkit mechanism just was not capable of solving. Some of you may
	  remember the early working title for the project being &ldquo;386BSD 0.5&rdquo;
	  or &ldquo;386BSD Interim&rdquo; in reference to that fact.</para>
	
	<para>386BSD was Bill Jolitz's operating system, which had been up to
	  that point suffering rather severely from almost a year's worth of
	  neglect. As the patchkit swelled ever more uncomfortably with each
	  passing day, we were in unanimous agreement that something had to be
	  done and decided to try and assist Bill by providing this interim
	  &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo; snapshot. Those plans came to a rude halt when Bill
	  Jolitz suddenly decided to withdraw his sanction from the project
	  and without any clear indication of what would be done
	  instead.</para>
	
	<para>It did not take us long to decide that the goal remained
	  worthwhile, even without Bill's support, and so we adopted the name
	  &ldquo;FreeBSD&rdquo;, coined by David Greenman. Our initial objectives were
	  set after consulting with the system's current users and, once it
	  became clear that the project was on the road to perhaps even
	  becoming a reality, I contacted Walnut Creek CDROM with an eye
	  towards improving FreeBSD's distribution channels for those many
	  unfortunates without easy access to the Internet. Walnut Creek
	  CDROM not only supported the idea of distributing FreeBSD on CD but
	  went so far as to provide the project with a machine to work on and
	  a fast Internet connection. Without Walnut Creek CDROM's almost
	  unprecedented degree of faith in what was, at the time, a completely
	  unknown project, it is quite unlikely that FreeBSD would have gotten
	  as far, as fast, as it has today.</para>
	
	<para>The first CDROM (and general net-wide) distribution was FreeBSD
	  1.0, released in December of 1993. This was based on the
	  4.3BSD-Lite (&ldquo;Net/2&rdquo;) tape from U.C. Berkeley, with many components
	  also provided by 386BSD and the Free Software Foundation. It was a
	  fairly reasonable success for a first offering, and we followed it
	  with the highly successful FreeBSD 1.1 release in May of
	  1994.</para>
	
	<para>Around this time, some rather unexpected storm clouds formed on
	  the horizon as Novell and U.C. Berkeley settled their long-running
	  lawsuit over the legal status of the Berkeley Net/2 tape. A
	  condition of that settlement was U.C. Berkeley's concession that
	  large parts of Net/2 were &ldquo;encumbered&rdquo; code and the property of
	  Novell, who had in turn acquired it from AT&amp;T some time
	  previously. What Berkeley got in return was Novell's &ldquo;blessing&rdquo;
	  that the 4.4BSD-Lite release, when it was finally released, would be
	  declared unencumbered and all existing Net/2 users would be strongly
	  encouraged to switch. This included FreeBSD, and the project was
	  given until the end of July 1994 to stop shipping its own Net/2
	  based product. Under the terms of that agreement, the project was
	  allowed one last release before the deadline, that release being
	  FreeBSD 1.1.5.1.</para>
	
	<para>FreeBSD then set about the arduous task of literally
	  re-inventing itself from a completely new and rather incomplete set
	  of 4.4BSD-Lite bits. The &ldquo;Lite&rdquo; releases were light in part because
	  Berkeley's CSRG had removed large chunks of code required for
	  actually constructing a bootable running system (due to various
	  legal requirements) and the fact that the Intel port of 4.4 was
	  highly incomplete. It took the project until December of 1994 to
	  make this transition, and in January of 1995 it released FreeBSD 2.0
	  to the net and on CDROM. Despite being still more than a little
	  rough around the edges, the release was a significant success and
	  was followed by the more robust and easier to install FreeBSD 2.0.5
	  release in June of 1995.</para>
	
	<para>We released FreeBSD 2.1.5 in August of 1996, and it appeared to
	  be popular enough among the ISP and commercial communities that
	  another release along the 2.1-stable branch was merited. This was
	  FreeBSD 2.1.7.1, released in February 1997 and capping the end of
	  mainstream development on 2.1-stable. Now in maintenance mode, only
	  security enhancements and other critical bug fixes will be done on
	  this branch (RELENG_2_1_0).</para>
	
	<para>FreeBSD 2.2 was branched from the development mainline
	  (&ldquo;-current&rdquo;) in November 1996 as the RELENG_2_2 branch, and the
	  first full release (2.2.1) was released in April, 1997. Further
	  releases along the 2.2 branch were done in the Summer and Fall of
	  '97, the latest being 2.2.7 which appeared in late July of '98.
	  The first official 3.0 release will appear in October, 1998 and the
      last release on the 2.2 branch, 2.2.8, will appear in November.</para>
	
	<para>Long term development projects for everything from SMP to DEC
	  ALPHA support will continue to take place in the 3.0-current branch
	  and SNAPshot releases of 3.0 on CDROM (and, of course, on the net).</para>

	<para><emphasis>Contributed by &a.jkh;</emphasis>.</para>
	
	<para>The goals of the FreeBSD Project are to provide software that
	  may be used for any purpose and without strings attached. Many of
	  us have a significant investment in the code (and project) and would
	  certainly not mind a little financial compensation now and then, but
	  we're definitely not prepared to insist on it. We believe that our
	  first and foremost &ldquo;mission&rdquo; is to provide code to any and all
	  comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets the widest
	  possible use and provides the widest possible benefit. This is, I
	  believe, one of the most fundamental goals of Free Software and one
	  that we enthusiastically support.</para>
	
	<para>That code in our source tree which falls under the GNU Public
	  License (GPL) or GNU Library Public License (GLPL) comes with
	  slightly more strings attached, though at least on the side of
	  enforced access rather than the usual opposite. Due to the
	  additional complexities that can evolve in the commercial use of GPL
	  software, we do, however, endeavor to replace such software with
	  submissions under the more relaxed BSD copyright whenever possible.</para>

	<title>About the Current Release</title>
	
	<para>FreeBSD is a freely available, full source 4.4BSD-Lite based
	  release for Intel i386/i486/Pentium/PentiumPro/Pentium II (or
	  compatible) based PC's. It is based primarily on software from U.C.
	  Berkeley's CSRG group, with some enhancements from NetBSD, OpenBSD,
	  386BSD, and the Free  Software Foundation.</para>
	
	<para>Since our release of FreeBSD 2.0 in January of 95, the
	  performance, feature set, and stability of FreeBSD has improved
	  dramatically. The largest change is a revamped virtual memory
	  system with a merged VM/file buffer  cache that not only increases
	  performance, but reduces FreeBSD's memory footprint, making a 5MB
	  configuration a more acceptable minimum. Other enhancements include
	  full NIS client and server support, transaction TCP support,
	  dial-on-demand PPP, an improved SCSI subsystem, early ISDN support,
	  support for FDDI and Fast Ethernet (100Mbit) adapters, improved
	  support for the Adaptec 2940 (WIDE and narrow) and many hundreds of
	  bug fixes.</para>
	
	<para>We have also taken the comments and suggestions of many of our
	  users to heart and have attempted to provide what we hope is a more
	  sane and easily understood installation process. Your feedback on
	  this (constantly evolving) process is especially welcome!</para>
	
	<para>In addition to the base distributions, FreeBSD offers a new
	  ported software collection with hundreds of commonly sought-after
	  programs. At the end of August 1998 there were more than 1700 ports!
	  The list of ports ranges from http (WWW) servers, to games,
	  languages, editors and almost everything in between. The entire
	  ports collection requires approximately 26MB of storage, all ports
	  being  expressed as &ldquo;deltas&rdquo; to their original sources. This
	  makes  it much easier for us to update ports, and greatly reduces
	  the disk space demands made by the older 1.0 ports collection. To
	  compile a port, you simply change to the directory of the program
	  you wish to install, type <command>make all</command> followed by <command>make install</command>
	  after successful compilation and let the system do the rest. The
	  full original distribution for each port you build is retrieved
	  dynamically off the CDROM or a local ftp site, so you need only
	  enough disk space to build the ports you want. (Almost) every port
	  is also provided as a pre-compiled &ldquo;package&rdquo; which can be installed
	  with a simple command (pkg_add) by those who do not wish to compile
	  their own ports from source.</para>

	  running FreeBSD 2.1 or later. You may view the locally installed
	  manuals with any HTML capable browser using the following

	<para>The core of FreeBSD does not contain DES code which would
	  inhibit its being exported outside the United States. There is an
	  add-on package to the core distribution, for use only in the United
	  States, that contains the programs that normally use DES. The
	  auxiliary packages provided separately can be used by anyone. A
	  freely (from outside the U.S.) exportable European distribution of
	  DES for our non-U.S. users also exists and is described in the
	  <ulink URL="../FAQ/FAQ.html">FreeBSD FAQ</ulink>.</para>
	
	<para>If password security for FreeBSD is all you need, and you have
	  no requirement for copying encrypted passwords from different hosts
	  (Suns, DEC machines, etc) into FreeBSD password entries, then
	  FreeBSD's MD5 based security may be all you require! We feel that
	  our default security model is more than a match for DES, and without
	  any messy export issues to deal with. If you are outside (or even
	  inside) the U.S., give it a try!</para>
