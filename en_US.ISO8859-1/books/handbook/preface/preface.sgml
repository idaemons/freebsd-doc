  Audience</bridgehead>

  <para>The FreeBSD newcomer will find that the first section of this
    book guides the user through the FreeBSD installation process, and
    gently introduces the concepts and conventions that underpin Unix.
    Working through this section requires little more than the desire
    to explore, and the ability to take on board new concepts as they
    are introduced.</para>

  <para>Once you have travelled this far, the second, far larger,
    section of the Handbook is a comprehensive reference to all manner
    of topics of interest to FreeBSD system administrators.  Some of
    these chapters may recommend that you do some prior reading, and
    this is noted in the synopsis at the beginning of each
    chapter.</para>

  First Edition</bridgehead>

    <para>This second edition is the culmination of over two years of
      work by the dedicated members of the FreeBSD Documentation
      Project.  The following are the major changes in this new
      edition:</para>

<!-- Talk a little about justification and other stylsheet changes? -->

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>

	and what the reader is expected to know.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>The content has been logically reorganized into three
	parts: "Getting Started", "System Administration", and

      <listitem>
	<para>Chapter 2 ("Installing FreeBSD") was completely

  <bridgehead id="preface-overview" renderas=sect1>Organization of This
  Book</bridgehead>

  <para>This book is split into three logically distinct sections.
    The first section, <emphasis>Getting Started</emphasis>, covers
    the installation and basic usage of FreeBSD.  It is expected that
    the reader will follow these chapters in sequence, possibly
    skipping chapters covering familiar topics.  The second section,
    <emphasis>System Administration</emphasis>, covers a broad
    collection of subjects that are of interest to more advanced
    FreeBSD users.  Each section begins with a succinct synopsis that
    describes what the chapter covers and what the reader is expected
    to already know.  This is meant to allow the casual reader to skip
    around to find chapters of interest.  The third section contains
    appendices of reference information.</para>

  <bridgehead id="preface-conv-commands"
  renderas=sect2>User Input</bridgehead>

  <para>Keys are rendered in <keycap>bold</keycap> to stand out from
    other text.  Key combinations that are meant to be typed
    simultaneously are rendered with `<literal>+</literal>' between
    the keys, such as:</para>

  <para>
    <keycombo action="simul">
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      <keycap>Alt</keycap>
      <keycap>Del</keycap>
    </keycombo>
  </para>

  <para>Keys that are meant to be typed in sequence will be separated with
    commas, for example:</para>

  <para>
    <keycombo action="simul">
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      <keycap>X</keycap>
    </keycombo>,
    <keycombo action="simul">
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      <keycap>S</keycap>
    </keycombo>
  </para>

  <para>Would mean that the user is expected to type the
    <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and <keycap>X</keycap> keys simultaneously
    and then to type the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and <keycap>S</keycap>
    keys simultaneously.</para>

  <bridgehead id="preface-conv-examples"
  renderas=sect2>Examples</bridgehead>

  <para>Examples starting with <devicename>E:\&gt;</devicename>
  indicate a MS-DOS command.  Unless otherwise noted, these commands
  may be executed from a "Command Prompt" window in a modern Microsoft
  Windows environment.</para>

  <screen><prompt>E:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>tools\fdimage floppies\kern.flp A:</userinput></screen>

  <para>Examples starting with &prompt.root; indicate a command that
    must be invoked as the superuser in FreeBSD.  You can login as
    <username>root</username> to type the command, or login as your
    normal account and use <application>su</application> to gain
    superuser privileges.</para>

  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=kern.flp of=/dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

  <para>Examples starting with &prompt.user; indicate a command that
    should be invoked from a normal user account.  Unless otherwise
    noted, C-shell syntax is used for setting environment variables
    and other shell commands.</para>

  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>top</userinput></screen>

  <bridgehead id="preface-acknowledgements"
  renderas=sect1>Acknowledgments</bridgehead>

  <para>The book you are holding represents the efforts of many hundreds of
    people around the world.  Whether they sent in fixes for typos, or
    submitted complete chapters, all the contributions have been
    useful.</para>

  <para>Several companies have supported the development of this
    document by paying authors to work on it full-time, paying for
    publication, etc.  In particular, BSDi (subsequently acquired by
    <ulink url="http://www.windriver.com">Wind River Systems</ulink>)
    paid members of the FreeBSD Documentation Project to work on
    improving this book full time leading up to the publication of the
    first printed edition in March 2000 (ISBN 1-57176-241-8).  Wind
    River Systems then paid several additional authors to make a
    number of improvements to the print-output infrastructure and to add
    additional chapters to the text.  This work culminated in the
    publication of the second printed edition in November 2001 (ISBN
    1-57176-303-1).</para>
