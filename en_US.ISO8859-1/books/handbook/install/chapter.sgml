  <title>Installing FreeBSD</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <indexterm><primary>installation</primary></indexterm>

    <para>FreeBSD is provided with a text-based, easy to use installation
      program called <application>SysInstall</application>.  This is the
      default installation program for FreeBSD, although vendors are free to
      provide their own installation suite if they wish.  This chapter
      describes how to use <application>SysInstall</application> to install
      FreeBSD.</para>

      <title>Inventory Your Computer</title>

      <para>Before installing FreeBSD you should attempt to inventory the
	components in your computer.  The FreeBSD installation routines will
	show you the components (hard disks, network cards, CDROM drives, and
	so forth) with their model number and manufacturer.  FreeBSD will also
	attempt to determine the correct configuration for these devices,
	which includes information about IRQ and memory usage.  Due to the
	vagaries of PC hardware this process is not always completely
	successful, and you may need to correct FreeBSD's determination of
	your configuration.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>If you already have another operating system installed, such as
	  Windows, or Linux, it is a good idea to use the facilities provided
	  by those operating systems to see how your hardware is already
	  configured.  We recommend you print or write down this information
	  before installing FreeBSD.</para>
      </tip>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Backup Your Data</title>
      
      <para>If the computer you will be installing FreeBSD on contains
	valuable data then ensure you have it backed up, and that you have
	tested the backups before installing FreeBSD.  The FreeBSD
	installation routine will prompt you several times before writing any
	data to your disk, but once that process has started it can not be
	undone.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Decide Where to Install FreeBSD</title>

      <para>If you want FreeBSD to use all your disk then there is nothing
	more to concern yourself with at this point, and you can skip to the
	next section..</para>

      <para>However, if you need FreeBSD to co-exist with other operating
	systems then you need to have a rough understanding of how data is
	laid out on the disk, and how this affects you.</para>

      <para>A PC disk can be divided in to up to four discrete chunks.  These
	chunks are called <firstterm>partitions</firstterm>.  One partition on
	each disk will be the primary partition, the others are extended
	partitions.  A disk does not need to be configured with all four
	partitions.  You might only have one partition on your disk at the
	moment, and that partition is taking up the whole space of the
	disk.  Each partition has a <firstterm>partition ID</firstterm>, which
	is a number, used to identify the type of data on the partition.
	FreeBSD partitions have the partition ID
	<literal>165</literal>.</para>

      <para>In general, each operating system that you use will identify
	partitions in a particular way.  For example, DOS, and its
	descendants, like Windows, assign each partition a <firstterm>drive
	  letter</firstterm>, starting with
	<devicename>C:</devicename>.</para>

      <para>FreeBSD keeps all your data in one partition, so you need to have
	one partition available when you install FreeBSD.  This might be a
	blank partition that you have prepared, or it might be an existing
	partition that contains data that you no longer care about.</para>

      <para>If you are already using all the partitions on all your disks then
	you will have to free one of them for FreeBSD to use, using the tools
	provided by the other operating systems you use (e.g.,
	<command>fdisk</command> on DOS or Windows).</para>

      <para>If you have a spare partition then you can use that.  However, you
	may need to shrink one or more of your existing partitions
	first.</para>

      <para>A minimal installation of FreeBSD takes as little as 35MB of disk
	space.  However, that is a <emphasis>very</emphasis> minimal install,
	leaving almost no space for your own files.  A more realistic minimum
	is 250MB without a graphical environment, and 350MB or more if you
	want a graphical user interface.  If you intend to install a lot of
	third party software as well then you will need more space.</para>

      <para>You can use a commercial tool such as <application>Partition
	  Magic</application> to resize your partitions to make space for
	FreeBSD.  The <filename>tools</filename> directory on the CDROM
	contains two free software tools which can carry out this task,
	<application>FIPS</application> and
	<application>PResizer</application>.  Documentation for both of these
	is in the same directory.</para>

      <warning>
	<para>Incorrect use of these tools can delete the data on your disk.
	  Be sure that you have recent, working backups before using
	  them.</para>
      </warning>

      <note>
	<para>Although FreeBSD will be installed in to the part of your disk
	  that is currently <devicename>D:</devicename>, that drive letter
	  will no longer be available in Windows.  FreeBSD can read and
	  write to DOS and Windows drives, but the reverse is not
	  true.</para>
      </note>

      <example>
	<title>Using an existing partition unchanged</title>

	<para>Suppose that you have a computer with a single 4GB disk, that
	  already has a version of Windows installed, and you have split the
	  disk in to two drive letters, <devicename>C:</devicename> and
	  <devicename>D:</devicename>, each of which is 2GB in size.  You have
	  1GB of data on <devicename>C:</devicename>, and 0.5GB of data on
	  <devicename>D:</devicename>.</para>

	<para>This means that your disk has two partitions on it, one per
	  drive letter.  You can copy all your existing data from
	  <devicename>D:</devicename> to <devicename>C:</devicename>, which
	  will free up the second partition, ready for FreeBSD.
      </example>

      <example>
	<title>Shrinking an existing partition</title>

	<para>Suppose that you have a computer with a single 4GB disk, that
	  already has a version of Windows installed.  When you installed
	  Windows you created one large partition, giving you a
	  <devicename>C:</devicename> drive that is 4GB in size.  You are
	  currently using 1.5GB of space, and want FreeBSD to have 2GB of
	  space.</para>

	<para>In order to install FreeBSD you will need to either:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Back up your Windows data, and then reinstall Windows,
	      asking for a 2GB partition at install time.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Use one of the tools such as <application>Partition
		Magic</application>, described above, to shrink your Windows
		partition.</para>

	</orderedlist>
      </example>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Check for FreeBSD Errata</title>
      
      <para>Although the FreeBSD project strives to ensure that each release
	of FreeBSD is as stable as possible, bugs do occasionally creep in to
	the process.  On very rare occasions those bugs affect the
	installation process.  As these problems are discovered and fixed they
	are noted in the FreeBSD Errata, posted on the FreeBSD web site.  You
	should check the errata before installing to make sure that there are
	no late-breaking problems which you should be aware of.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="install-floppies">
      <title>Prepare the Boot Discs</title>
      
      <para>FreeBSD can be installed from a number of different media; CDROM,
	DVD, FTP (both anonymous and non-anonymous), NFS, tape, or an existing
	MS-DOS partition.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>If you have FreeBSD on CDROM or DVD, and your computer allows
	  you to boot from the CDROM or DVD (typically a BIOS option called
	  <quote>Boot Order</quote> or similar) then you can skip this
	  section. The FreeBSD CDROM and DVD images are bootable, and can be
	  used to install FreeBSD without any other special
	  preparation.</para>
      </tip>
    
      <para>The FreeBSD installation process is started by booting your
	computer in to the FreeBSD installer&mdash;it is not a program you run
	from within another operating system.  To do this you must create some
	floppy disks that can be booted from, and then boot from them.</para>

      <para>If you are <emphasis>not</emphasis> installing directly from CDROM
	or DVD then you are probably preparing your own installation media
	(e.g., FTP, or an MS-DOS partition), which must be prepared before you
	install FreeBSD.  This is a slightly more advanced, and infrequent
	activity, and is documented in <xref
	linkend="install-diff-media">.</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <title>Acquire the Boot Floppy Images</title>
	  
	  <para>The boot discs are available on your installation media, and
	    can also be downloaded from the <ulink
	    url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/floppies/">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/floppies/</ulink> directory.</para>

	  <para>The floppy images have a <filename>.flp</filename> extension.
	    The <filename>floppies/</filename> directory contains a number of
	    different images, and the ones you will need to use depends on the
	    version of FreeBSD you are installing, and in some cases, the
	    hardware you are installing to.  In most cases you will need two
	    files, <filename>kern.flp</filename> and
	    <filename>mfsroot.flp</filename>, but check
	    <filename>README.TXT</filename> in the same directory to be
	    sure.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Prepare the Floppy Disks</title>
	  
	  <para>You must prepare one floppy disk per image file you had to
	    download.  It is imperative that these disks are free from
	    defects.  The easiest way to test this is to format the disks
	    for yourself.  Do not trust pre-formatted floppies.</para>
	  
	  <important>
	    <para>If you try to install FreeBSD and the installation
	      program crashes, freezes, or otherwise misbehaves one of
	      the first things to suspect is the floppies.  Try writing
	      the floppy image files to some other disks, and try
	      again.</para>
	  </important>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Write the Image Files to the Floppy Disks.</title>

	  <para>The <filename>.flp</filename> files are
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> regular files you copy to the disk.
	    Instead, they are images of the complete contents of the
	    disk.  This means that you can <emphasis>not</emphasis> use
	    commands like DOS' <command>copy</command> to write the
	    files.  Instead, you must use specific tools to write the
	    images directly to the disk.</para>

	  <indexterm><primary>DOS</primary></indexterm>
	  <para>If you are creating the floppies on a computer running DOS 
	    then we provide a tool to do this called
	    <command>fdimage</command>.</para>

	  <para>If you are using the floppies from the CDROM, and your
	    CDROM is the <devicename>E:</devicename> drive then you would 
	    run this:</para>

	  <screen><prompt>E:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>tools\fdimage floppies\kern.flp A:</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Repeat this command for each <filename>.flp</filename>
	    file, replacing the floppy disk each time, and being sure to label
	    the disks with the name of the file that you copied to them.
	    Adjust the command line as necessary, depending on where you have
	    placed the <filename>.flp</filename> files.  If you do not have
	    the CDROM then <command>fdimage</command> can be downloaded from
	    the <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/tools/"><filename>tools</filename> directory</ulink> on the FreeBSD FTP site.</para>
	  
	  <para>If you are writing the floppies on a Unix system (such as
	    another FreeBSD system) you can use the &man.dd.1; command to
	    write the image files directly to disk.  On FreeBSD you would
	    run:</para>
	  
	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=kern.flp of=/dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

	  <para>On FreeBSD <filename>/dev/fd0</filename> refers to the
	    first floppy disk (the <devicename>A:</devicename> drive).
	    <filename>/dev/fd1</filename> would be the
	    <devicename>B:</devicename> drive, and so on.  Other Unix
	    variants might have different names for the floppy disk
	    devices, and you will need to check the documentation for the
	    system as necessary.</para>

      <para>Although you should not experience any difficulty, there is

	the &a.doc;.  It is the objective of the installation program
	(sysinstall) to be self-documenting enough that painful

<screen>                         User Confirmation Requested
 Would you like to install the FreeBSD ports collection? 

 This will give you ready access to over 5000 ported software packages,
 at a cost of around 70MB of disk space when "clean" and possibly much
 more than that if a lot of the distribution tarballs are loaded
 (unless you have the extra CDs from a FreeBSD CDROM distribution
 available and can mount it on /cdrom, in which case this is far less
 of a problem). 

 The ports collection is a very valuable resource and well worth having
 on your /usr partition, so it is advisable to say Yes to this option. 

 For more information on the ports collection & the latest ports,
 visit: 
     http://www.freebsd.org/ports

    <title>Supported Hardware</title>

    <indexterm><primary>hardware</primary></indexterm>
    <para>FreeBSD currently runs on a wide variety of ISA, VLB, EISA, and
      PCI bus-based PCs with Intel, AMD, Cyrix, or NexGen
      <quote>x86</quote> processors, as well as a number of
      machines based on the Compaq Alpha processor.
      Support for generic IDE or
      ESDI drive configurations, various SCSI controllers, PCMCIA
      cards, USB devices, and network and
      serial cards is also provided.  FreeBSD also supports IBM's
      microchannel (MCA) bus.</para>

    <para>A list of supported hardware is provided with each FreeBSD
      release in the FreeBSD Hardware Notes.  This document can
      usually be found in a file named
      <filename>HARDWARE.TXT</filename>, in the top-level directory of
      a CDROM or FTP distribution or in sysinstall's documentation
      menu.  It lists, for a given architecture, what hardware devices
      are known to be supported by each release of FreeBSD.</para>

    <para>The following section covers basic installation troubleshooting,
      such as common problems people have reported.  There are also a few
      questions and answers for people wishing to dual-boot FreeBSD with
      MS-DOS.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>What to Do If Something Goes Wrong...</title>

      <para>Due to various limitations of the PC architecture, it is
        impossible for probing to be 100% reliable, however, there are a
        few things you can do if it fails.</para>

      <para>Check the Hardware Notes document for your version of
        FreeBSD to make sure your hardware is
        supported.</para>

      <para>If your hardware is supported and you still experience
        lock-ups or other problems, reset your computer, and when the
        visual kernel configuration option is given, choose it.  This will
        allow you to go through your hardware and supply information to the
        system about it.  The kernel on the boot disks is configured
        assuming that most hardware devices are in their factory default
        configuration in terms of IRQs, IO addresses, and DMA channels.  If
        your hardware has been reconfigured, you will most likely need to
        use the configuration editor to tell FreeBSD where to find
        things.</para>

      <para>It is also possible that a probe for a device not present will
        cause a later probe for another device that is present to fail.  In
        that case, the probes for the conflicting driver(s) should be
        disabled.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Do not disable any drivers you will need during the
          installation, such as your screen (<devicename>sc0</devicename>).
	  If the installation wedges or fails mysteriously after leaving
	  the configuration editor, you have probably removed or changed
	  something you should not have.  Reboot and try again.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>In configuration mode, you can:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>List the device drivers installed in the kernel.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Change device drivers for hardware that is not present in
	    your system.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Change IRQs, DRQs, and IO port addresses used by a device
	    driver.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>After adjusting the kernel to match your hardware
        configuration, type <command>Q</command> to boot with the new
        settings.  Once the installation has completed, any changes you
        made in the configuration mode will be permanent so you do not have
        to reconfigure every time you boot.  It is still highly likely that
        you will eventually want to build a <link

      <title>MS-DOS User's Questions and Answers</title>

      <indexterm><primary>DOS</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Many users wish to install FreeBSD on PCs inhabited by MS-DOS.
        Here are some commonly asked questions about installing FreeBSD on
        such systems.</para>

      <qandaset>
        <qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>Help, I have no space!  Do I need to delete everything 
	      first?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>If your machine is already running MS-DOS and has little
	      or no free space available for the FreeBSD installation, all
	      hope is not lost!  You may find the <application>FIPS</application>
	      utility, provided
	      in the <filename>tools</filename> directory on the FreeBSD
	      CDROM or various FreeBSD FTP sites to be quite
	      useful.</para>

	    <indexterm>
        <primary><command>FIPS</command></primary>
      </indexterm>
	    <para><application>FIPS</application> allows you to split an
	      existing MS-DOS partition
	      into two pieces, preserving the original partition and
	      allowing you to install onto the second free piece.  You
	      first defragment your MS-DOS partition using the Windows
	      <application>DEFRAG</application> utility (go into Explorer,
	      right-click on the
	      hard drive, and choose to defrag your
	      hard drive), or Norton Disk Tools. You then must run 
	      <application>FIPS</application>.  It
	      will prompt you for the rest of the information it needs.
	      Afterwards, you can reboot and install FreeBSD on the new
	      free slice.  See the <emphasis>Distributions</emphasis> menu
	      for an estimate of how much free space you will need for the
	      kind of installation you want.</para>

	    <indexterm>
        <primary><application>Partition Magic</application></primary>
      </indexterm>
	    <para>There is also a <emphasis>very</emphasis> useful
	      product from <ulink
	      url="http://www.powerquest.com/">PowerQuest</ulink>
	      called <application>Partition Magic</application>. This
	      application has far more functionality than 
	      <application>FIPS</application>, and is
	      highly recommended if you plan to often add/remove
	      operating systems (like me). However, it does cost
	      money, and if you plan to install FreeBSD once and then
	      leave it there, <application>FIPS</application> will probably 
	      be fine for you.</para>
	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>Can I use compressed MS-DOS filesystems from
	      FreeBSD?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>No.  If you are using a utility such as Stacker(tm) or
	      DoubleSpace(tm), FreeBSD will only be able to use whatever
	      portion of the filesystem you leave uncompressed.  The rest
	      of the filesystem will show up as one large file (the
	      stacked/double spaced file!).  <emphasis>Do not remove that
	      file or you will probably regret it
	      greatly!</emphasis></para>

	    <para>It is probably better to create another uncompressed
	      primary MS-DOS partition and use this for communications
	      between MS-DOS and FreeBSD.</para>
	  </answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	  <question>
	    <para>Can I mount my extended MS-DOS partition?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <indexterm><primary>partitions</primary></indexterm>
	    <indexterm><primary>slices</primary></indexterm>
	    <para>Yes.  DOS extended partitions are mapped in at the end
	      of the other <quote>slices</quote> in FreeBSD, e.g., your
	      <devicename>D:</devicename> drive might be
	      <filename>/dev/da0s5</filename>, your
	      <devicename>E:</devicename> drive,
	      <filename>/dev/da0s6</filename>, and so on.  This example
	      assumes, of course, that your extended partition is on SCSI
	      drive 0.  For IDE drives, substitute <filename>ad</filename>
	      for <filename>da</filename> appropriately if installing
	      4.0-RELEASE or later, and substitute
	      <filename>wd</filename> for <filename>da</filename> if you
	      are installing a version of FreeBSD prior to 4.0.  You otherwise
	      mount extended partitions exactly like you would any other
	      DOS drive, for example:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t msdos /dev/ad0s5 /dos_d</userinput></screen>

    <title>Advanced Installation Guide</title>

    <para>This section describes how to install FreeBSD in exceptional
       cases.</para>

    <sect2 id="headless-install">
      <title>Installing FreeBSD on a System without a Monitor or
        Keyboard</title>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>installation</primary>
        <secondary>headless (serial console)</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>serial console</primary></indexterm>
      <para>This type of installation is called a "headless install",
        because the machine that you are trying to install FreeBSD on
        either doesnt have a monitor attached to it, or doesnt even
        have a VGA output. How is this possible you ask? Using a
        serial console. A serial console is basically using another
        machine to act as the main display and keyboard for a
        system. To do this, just follow these steps:</para>

      <procedure>
        <step>
          <title>Fetch the Right Boot Floppy Images</title>

          <para>First you will need to get the right disk images so
            that you can boot into the install program. The secret
            with using a serial console is that you tell the boot
            loader to send I/O through a serial port instead of
            displaying console output to the VGA device and trying to
            read input from a local keyboard.  Enough of that now,
            let's get back to getting these disk images.</para>

	  <para>You will need to get <ulink url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/floppies/kern.flp">kern.flp</ulink> and
            <ulink url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/floppies/mfsroot.flp">
            mfsroot.flp</ulink> from the
            <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/floppies/">
            floppies directory</ulink>.</para>

        </step>
        <step>
	  <title>Write the Image Files to the Floppy Disks.</title>

          <para>The image files, such as
	    <filename>kern.flp</filename>, are
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> regular files that you copy to
	    the disk.  Instead, they are images of the complete
	    contents of the disk.</para>

	  <para>This means that you can <emphasis>not</emphasis> use
	    commands like DOS' <command>copy</command> to write the
	    files.  Instead, you must use specific tools to write the
	    images directly to the disk.</para>
	  
	  <indexterm>
      <primary><command>fdimage</command></primary>
    </indexterm>
	  <para>If you are creating the floppies on a computer running

	<para>If you must install from floppy disk (which we suggest you
	  do <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> do), either due to unsupported
	  hardware or simply because you insist on doing things the hard
	  way, you must first prepare some floppies for the installation.</para>

	<para>At a minimum, you will need as many 1.44MB or 1.2MB floppies
	  as it takes to hold all the files in the
	  <filename>bin</filename> (binary distribution) directory.  If
	  you are preparing the floppies from DOS, then they
	  <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> be formatted using the MS-DOS
	  <command>FORMAT</command> command.  If you are using Windows,
	  use Explorer to format the disks (right-click on the
	  <devicename>A:</devicename> drive, and select &quot;Format&quot;.</para>

	<para>Do <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> trust factory pre-formatted
	  floppies!  Format them again yourself, just to be sure.  Many
	  problems reported by our users in the past have resulted from
	  the use of improperly formatted media, which is why we are
	  making a point of it now.</para>

	<para>If you are creating the floppies on another FreeBSD machine,
	  a format is still not a bad idea, though you do not need to put
	  a DOS filesystem on each floppy.  You can use the
	  <command>disklabel</command> and <command>newfs</command>
	  commands to put a UFS filesystem on them instead, as the
	  following sequence of commands (for a 3.5" 1.44MB floppy)
	  illustrates:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fdformat -f 1440 fd0.1440</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>disklabel -w -r fd0.1440 floppy3</userinput>

	</note>

	<para>Then you can mount and write to them like any other
	  filesystem.</para>

	<para>After you have formatted the floppies, you will need to copy
	  the files to them.  The distribution files are split into chunks
	  conveniently sized so that 5 of them will fit on a conventional
	  1.44MB floppy.  Go through all your floppies, packing as many
	  files as will fit on each one, until you have all of the
	  distributions you want packed up in this fashion.  Each
	  distribution should go into a subdirectory on the floppy, e.g.:
	  <filename>a:\bin\bin.aa</filename>,
	  <filename>a:\bin\bin.ab</filename>, and so on.</para>

	<para>To prepare for an installation from an MS-DOS partition,

	<para>Installing from tape is probably the easiest method, short

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /freebsd/distdir</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tar cvf /dev/rwt0 dist1 ... dist2</userinput></screen>

  </indexterm>
	<para>There are three types of network installations you can do.
	  Serial port (SLIP or PPP), Parallel port (PLIP (laplink cable)),
	  or Ethernet (a standard Ethernet controller (includes some
	  PCMCIA)).</para>

	<para>The SLIP support is rather primitive, and limited primarily
	  to hard-wired links, such as a serial cable running between a
	  laptop computer and another computer.  The link should be
	  hard-wired as the SLIP installation does not currently offer a
	  dialing capability; that facility is provided with the PPP
	  utility, which should be used in preference to SLIP whenever
	  possible.</para>

	<para>If you are using a modem, then PPP is almost certainly
	  your only choice.  Make sure that you have your service
	  provider's information handy as you will need to know it fairly
	  early in the installation process.</para>  
	  <para>If you use PAP or CHAP to connect your ISP (in other
	  words, if you can connect to the ISP in Windows without
	  using a script), then all you will need to do is type in
	  <command>dial</command> at the
	  <application>ppp</application> prompt. Otherwise,
	  you will need to know
	  how to dial your ISP using the <quote>AT commands</quote>
	  specific to your modem, as the PPP dialer provides only a very
	  simple terminal emulator. Please refer
	  to the user-ppp <link linkend="userppp">handbook</link> and <ulink
	  url="../FAQ/ppp.html">FAQ</ulink> entries for further
	  information.  If you have problems, logging can be directed to
	  the screen using the command <command>set log local
	  ...</command>.</para>

	<para>If a hard-wired connection to another FreeBSD (2.0-R or
	  later) machine is available, you might also consider installing
	  over a <quote>laplink</quote> parallel port cable.  The data rate
	  over the parallel port is much higher than what is typically
	  possible over a serial line (up to 50kbytes/sec), thus resulting
	  in a quicker installation.</para>

	<para>Finally, for the fastest possible network installation, an
	  Ethernet adapter is always a good choice!  FreeBSD supports most
	  common PC Ethernet cards; a table of supported cards (and their
	  required settings) is provided in the Hardware Notes
	  for each release of FreeBSD.  If you are
	  using one of the supported PCMCIA Ethernet cards, also be sure
	  that it is plugged in <emphasis>before</emphasis> the laptop is
	  powered on!  FreeBSD does not, unfortunately, currently support
	  hot insertion of PCMCIA cards during installation.</para>

	<para>You will also need to know your IP address on the network,
	  the netmask value for your address class, and the name of your
	  machine.  If you are installing over a PPP connection and do not
	  have a static IP, fear not, the IP address can be dynamically
	  assigned by your ISP.  Your system administrator can tell you
	  which values to use for your particular network setup.  If you
	  will be referring to other hosts by name rather than IP address,
	  you will also need a name server and possibly the address of a
	  gateway (if you are using PPP, it is your provider's IP address)
	  to use in talking to it.  If you want to install by FTP via a
	  HTTP proxy (see below), you will also need the proxy's address.
	  If you do not know the answers to all or most of these questions,
	  then you should really probably talk to your system administrator
	  or ISP <emphasis>before</emphasis> trying this type of
	  installation.</para>

	  <para>If this server supports only <quote>privileged port</quote>

	    from very slow transfer rates, you may also wish to toggle the
	    appropriate Options flag.</para>

	  <para>In order for NFS installation to work, the server must

	    directory lives
	    on:<filename>ziggy:/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>, then
	    <hostid>ziggy</hostid> will have to allow the direct mounting
	    of <filename>/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>, not just
	    <filename>/usr</filename> or
	    <filename>/usr/archive/stuff</filename>.</para>

	  <para>In FreeBSD's <filename>/etc/exports</filename> file, this
	    is controlled by the <option>-alldirs</option>.  Other NFS
	    servers may have different conventions.  If you are getting
