<!--
     Names and email address of teams of people working on specified
     tasks. Usally they're just mail aliases set up at hub.FreeBSD.org

     Use these entities when referencing appropriate teams.

     Please keep this list in alphabetical order by entity names.

     IMPORTANT:  If you delete names from this file you *must* ensure that
                 all references to them have been removed from the handbook's
                 translations.  If they haven't then you *will* break the
                 builds for the other languages, and we will poke fun of you
                 in public.
