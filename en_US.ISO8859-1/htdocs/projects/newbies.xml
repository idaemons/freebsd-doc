    <p>The following resources are some of those which &os; newbies

    <h2><a name="web-site">Using the &os; web site</a></h2>

    <p>The latest &os; releases are available <a
      href="&enbase;/where.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>This web site is the main source of up to date information
      about &os;. Newbies have found the following pages particularly
      helpful:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><a href="&base;/search/search.html">Search</a> the
	Handbook and FAQ, the whole web site, or the &os; mailing list
	archives.</p></li>

      <li><p>The <a href="&base;/support.html">Support</a> page
	contains a wealth of information about &os;, including mailing
	lists, user groups, web and FTP sites, release information,
	and links to some sources of &unix; information.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="fbsd">Learning about &os;</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li><p>You should most probably look for the <a
	  href="&u.rel.announce;">latest mainstream release</a>.  (See
	the Handbook for why you should <strong>not</strong> be
	tempted by any of the other branches.) Before you begin,
	carefully read the <a
	href="&url.books;/handbook/bsdinstall.html">installation
	instructions</a>, as well as each one of the *.TXT files in
	the FTP directory or on the installation CD. They are there
	because they contain information that you will need. Also pick
	up the latest <a href="&base;/releases/index.html">errata
	file</a> from the web site, in case it has been
	updated.</p></li>

      <li><p>The <a href="&url.books;/handbook/index.html">&os;
	Handbook</a> and <a
	href="&url.books;/faq/index.html">Frequently Asked Questions
	(FAQ)</a> are the main documents for &os;. Essential reading,
	they contain a lot of material for newbies as well as some
	pretty advanced stuff. Do not worry if you are unable to
	understand the advanced sections. The handbook contains the
	installation instructions and also provides lists of books and
	on-line resources, and the FAQ has a troubleshooting
	section.</p></li>

      <li><p>Join the &os;-Questions mailing list to see the questions
	you were too afraid to ask, and their answers. Subscribe by
	filling out the following form: <a
	href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions">http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions</a>.
	You can look up old questions and answers via the <a
	href="&base;/search/search.html#mailinglists">search</a>
	page.</p></li>

      <li><p>The &os; <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org">Forums</a>
	offer another support channel.  Many users have written various
	tutorials and lots of new users receive help there.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="&cgibase;/man.cgi">Manual pages</a> are good for
	reference but not always the best introduction for a novice.
	They generally provide information on a specific command,
	driver or service.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="derived">Learning about &os;-derived projects</a></h2>

    <p>&os; is widely used as a building block for other commercial
      and open-source operating systems.  Some of the most widely used
      and publicly available systems are listed below.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><a href="http://www.pcbsd.org">PC-BSD</a> is a &os;
	derivative with a graphical installer and impressive desktop
	tools aimed at ease of use for the casual computer
	user.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="http://www.pfsense.org">pfSense</a> is a &os;
	free network security solution, based on &os;.  pfSense
	software, with the help of the package system, is able to
	provide the same functionality or more of common commercial
	firewalls, without any of the artificial limitations.  It has
	successfully replaced every big name commercial firewall you can
	imagine in numerous installations around the world.</p></li>

      <li><p>Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx">Mac OS
	X</a> is <a
	href="http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/technology/unix.html">based
	in part</a> on &os; and includes a rich &unix; foundation in
	addition to the proprietary Apple user interface.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="xwin">Learning about the X Window System</a></h2>

    <p>The X Window System is used with a number of operating systems,
      including &os;. The documentation for X can be found at the <a
	href="http://www.x.org/">X.Org Foundation</a> web site.
      Beware, much of this documentation is reference material which
      is more likely to be difficult for newcomers to digest.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><p>Before you can get X running exactly the way you like, you
      will need to choose a window manager.  Visit the <a
      href="http://xwinman.org/">Window Managers for X</a> page and
      follow the link to the introduction to find out about window
      managers, then return and read "The Basics". Then go back and
      compare the different types that are available. (Bonus: there is
      another beginners guide to UNIX there too.) Most, if not all, of
      these window managers are available to install from the &os;
      Ports Collection.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="people">Helping other people</a></h2>

    <p>Everyone has something to contribute to the &os; community,
      even newbies! Some are busy working with the new advocacy group
      and some have become involved with the <a
	href="&base;/docproj/docproj.html">Documentation Project</a> as
      reviewers.  Other &os; newbies might have particular skills and
      experiences to share, either computer related or not, or just
      want to meet new newbies and make them feel welcome. There are
      always people around who help others simply because they like
      to.</p>

    <p>Friends who run &os; are a great resource. No book can replace
      chatting on the phone or across a pizza with someone who has the
      same interests, enjoys similar accomplishments, and faces the
      same challenges. If you do not have many friends who use &os;,
      consider using your old &os; CDs to create some more.</p>

    <p><a href="&base;/usergroups.html">User groups</a> are good
      places to meet other &os; users. If there is no one nearby, you
      might consider starting one!</p>

    <p>Before talking to real humans about your new skills, you might
      want to check the <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/">Jargon
      File</a>.</p>
