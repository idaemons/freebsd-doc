<p>This distribution is a snapshot of FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE, the
latest point along the 10.0-STABLE branch.

<p>FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite for AMD64
and Intel EM64T based PC hardware (amd64), Intel, AMD, Cyrix or
NexGen <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class=
"quote">x86</span>&#8221;</span> based PC hardware (i386), Intel
Itanium Processor based computers (ia64), NEC PC-9801/9821 series
PCs and compatibles (pc98), and <span class=
"trademark">UltraSPARC</span>® machines (sparc64). Versions for the
<span class="trademark">ARM</span>® (arm), <span class=
"trademark">MIPS</span>® (mips), and <span class=
"trademark">PowerPC</span>® (powerpc) architectures are currently
under development as well. FreeBSD works with a wide variety of
peripherals and configurations and can be used for everything from
software development to games to Internet Service Provision.
<p>This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need to run such
a system, including full source code for the kernel and all
utilities in the base distribution. With the source distribution
installed, you can literally recompile the entire system from
scratch with one command, making it ideal for students,
researchers, or users who simply want to see how it all works.
<p>A large collection of third-party ported software (the
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Ports
Collection</span>&#8221;</span>) is also provided to make it easy
to obtain and install all your favorite traditional <span class=
"trademark">UNIX</span>® utilities for FreeBSD. Each <span class=
"quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">port</span>&#8221;</span>
consists of a set of scripts to retrieve, configure, build, and
install a piece of software, with a single command. Over 24,000
ports, from editors to programming languages to graphical
applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and comprehensive operating
environment that extends far beyond what's provided by many
commercial versions of <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>®. Most
ports are also available as pre-compiled <span class=
"quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">packages</span>&#8221;</span>,
which can be quickly installed from the installation program.</div>

<h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id=
"idp61857488"></a>1.2.&nbsp;Target Audience</h3></div></div></div>
<p>This snapshot is aimed primarily at early adopters and various
other users who want to get involved with the ongoing development
of FreeBSD. While the FreeBSD development team tries its best to
ensure that each snapshot works as advertised, 10.0-STABLE is very
much a work-in-progress.
<p>The basic requirements for using this snapshot are technical
proficiency with FreeBSD and an understanding of the ongoing
development process of FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE (as discussed on the
<a class="link" href=
"http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-stable" target=
"_top">FreeBSD-STABLE mailing list</a>).
<p>For those more interested in doing business with FreeBSD than in
experimenting with new FreeBSD technology, formal releases (such as
9.2-RELEASE) are frequently more appropriate. Releases undergo a
period of testing and quality assurance checking to ensure high
reliability and dependability.</div></div>

<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style=
"clear: both"><a id="obtain"></a>2.&nbsp;Obtaining
FreeBSD</h2></div></div></div>
<p>FreeBSD may be obtained in a variety of ways. This section
focuses on those ways that are primarily useful for obtaining a
complete FreeBSD distribution, rather than updating an existing
installation.
<div class="sect2">
<div xmlns="" class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id=
"idp61868752"></a>2.1.&nbsp;CDROM and DVD</h3></div></div></div>
<p>FreeBSD -RELEASE distributions may be ordered on CDROM or DVD
from several publishers. This is frequently the most convenient way
to obtain FreeBSD for new installations, as it provides a
convenient way to quickly reinstall the system if necessary. Some
distributions include some of the optional, precompiled
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class=
"quote">packages</span>&#8221;</span> from the FreeBSD Ports
Collection, or other extra material.
<p>A list of the CDROM and DVD publishers known to the project are
listed in the <a class="link" href=
"../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors.html"

<div>
<h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id=
"idp61886032"></a>2.2.&nbsp;FTP</h3></div></div></div>
<p>You can use FTP to retrieve FreeBSD and any or all of its
optional packages from <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href=
"ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/" target=
"_top">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/</a></code>, which is the official
FreeBSD release site, or any of its <span class=
"quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">mirrors</span>&#8221;</span>.
<p>Lists of locations that mirror FreeBSD can be found in the
<a class="link" href=
"../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html"
target="_top">FTP Sites</a> section of the Handbook. Finding a
close (in networking terms) mirror from which to download the
distribution is highly recommended.
<p>Additional mirror sites are always welcome. Contact <code class=
"email">&lt;<a xmlns="" class="email" href=
"mailto:freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;</code>
for more details on becoming an official mirror site. You can also
find useful information for mirror sites at the <a class="link"
href="../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/hubs/" target=
"_top">Mirroring FreeBSD</a> article.
<p>Mirrors generally contain the ISO images generally used to
create a CDROM of a FreeBSD release. They usually also contain
floppy disk images (for applicable platforms), as well as the files
necessary to do an installation over the network. Finally mirrors
sites usually contain a set of packages for the most current
release.</div></div>

"_top">FreeBSD-STABLE mailing list</a>, in order to keep abreast of
recent developments and changes that may affect the way you use and
maintain the system.
<p>Being a largely-volunteer effort, the FreeBSD Project is always
happy to have extra hands willing to help&#8212;there are already
far more desired enhancements than there is time to implement them.
To contact the developers on technical matters, or with offers of
help, please send mail to the <a class="link" href=

<p>Please note that these mailing lists can experience <span class=
"emphasis"><em>significant</em></span> amounts of traffic. If you
have slow or expensive mail access, or are only interested in
keeping up with major FreeBSD events, you may find it preferable to
subscribe instead to the <a class="link" href=

<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Problem
Reports</span>&#8221;</span> (PRs) submitted in this way will be
filed and their progress tracked; the FreeBSD developers will do
their best to respond to all reported bugs as soon as possible.

<p>A number of other files provide more specific information about
this snapshot distribution. These files are provided in various
formats. Most distributions will include both ASCII text
(<code class="filename">.TXT</code>) and HTML (<code class=

include other formats such as Portable Document Format
(<code class="filename">.PDF</code>).

<p>As with almost all <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® like
operating systems, FreeBSD comes with a set of on-line manual
pages, accessed through the <a class="citerefentry" href=
"http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=man&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry">
<span class="refentrytitle">man</span>(1)</span></a> command or
through the <a class="link" href=
"http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi" target="_top">hypertext manual
pages gateway</a> on the FreeBSD Web site. In general, the manual
pages provide information on the different commands and APIs
available to the FreeBSD user.
<p>In some cases, manual pages are written to give information on
particular topics. Notable examples of such manual pages are
<a class="citerefentry" href=
"http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tuning&amp;sektion=7"><span class="citerefentry">

<p>Two highly-useful collections of FreeBSD-related information,
maintained by the FreeBSD Project, are the FreeBSD Handbook and
FreeBSD FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions document). On-line versions
of the <a class="link" href=

are always available from the <a class="link" href=
"../../../../docs.html" target="_top">FreeBSD Documentation
page</a> or its mirrors. If you install the <code class=
"filename">doc</code> distribution set, you can use a Web browser
to read the Handbook and FAQ locally. In particular, note that the
Handbook contains a step-by-step guide to installing FreeBSD.
<p>A number of on-line books and articles, also maintained by the
FreeBSD Project, cover more-specialized, FreeBSD-related topics.
This material spans a wide range of topics, from effective use of
the mailing lists, to dual-booting FreeBSD with other operating
systems, to guidelines for new committers. Like the Handbook and
FAQ, these documents are available from the FreeBSD Documentation
Page or in the <code class="filename">doc</code> distribution set.
<p>A listing of other books and documents about FreeBSD can be
found in the <a class="link" href=
"../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/bibliography.html"
target="_top">bibliography</a> of the FreeBSD Handbook. Because of
FreeBSD's strong <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® heritage,
many other articles and books written for <span class=

which are also listed in the bibliography.</div></div>
