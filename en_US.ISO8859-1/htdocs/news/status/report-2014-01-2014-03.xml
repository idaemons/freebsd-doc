      <p>Chromium is the open source web browser project from which
	Google Chrome draws its source code.  The browsers share the
	majority of code and features, though there are some minor
	differences in features and they have different licensing.  Over
	the last four years, the Chromium team has been busy with
	porting Chromium to &os;.  This involves patching the browser so
	that it runs on &os;, tracking and documenting security updates,
	and merging patches back upstream.</p>

      <p>While there are already several browsers available for &os;,
	advantages of Chromium are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Quick response from upstream to security issues, resulting
	  in approximately bi-weekly updates.</li>

	<li>A testbed for security features of &os;, like Capsicum.
	  While support for this capability and sandbox framework is
	  currently not included in the browser, a proof-of-concept
	  implementation for an early version of Chromium was realized
	  within a single weekend.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>George Liaskos and &a.rene; are currently busy with submitting
	the remaining patches specific to &os; back upstream.  Apart from
	making future updates easier, it sometimes also improves the
	overall code quality.</p>

      <p>&a.jonathan; recently updated the Capsicum patches for Chromium
	and is talking to upstream about them.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>Advocate &os;.  While patches are getting accepted by both
	humans and bots, it is not an official platform so attitude varies
	from developer to developer.  While &a.rene; thinks it is a bit
	early, it might be fruitful to investigate what is required to
	make &os; (and possibly OpenBSD) an official platform in terms
	of both hardware and procedures.</task>

      <task>If you feel comfortable with large source trees, you can try
	to build the Git version of Chromium on &os;.  If you are also
	comfortable with signing Googles Contributor License Agreement,
	you can join testing and submitting patches upstream.</task>

      <p>ZFS is one of the premier features of &os;.  The current
	documentation in the Handbook and elsewhere online is severely
	lacking.  Much of the original documentation from Sun and Oracle
	has disappeared, moved, or is about the proprietary version of
	ZFS.</p>

      <p>New users have many questions about ZFS and yet there exists a
	great deal more bad advice about ZFS than proper documentation.
	The current ZFS chapter of the &os; Handbook starts off with the
	required steps to configure an i386 machine to run ZFS.  This is
	more likely to scare off a new user than to educate them about
	how to properly use ZFS.</p>

      <p>At BSDCan&nbsp;2013, the process of writing an entirely new
	chapter of the Handbook on ZFS was started.  Currently this
	chapter consists of approximately 16,000 words covering all
	subcommands of the <tt>zpool(8)</tt> and <tt>zfs(8)</tt>
	utilities, delegation, tuning and a section devoted to
	defintions and explainations of the terms and features of
	ZFS.</p>

      <p>The remaining section is the FAQ.  To help users address the
	most common problems they might run into with ZFS.  It would be
	useful to hear experiences, questions, misconceptions, gotchas,
	stumbling blocks and suggestions for the FAQ section from other
	users.  Also, a use cases section that highlights some of the
	cases where ZFS provides advantages over traditional file
	systems.</p>

      <p>In early January, the &os; Release Engineering Team became
	aware of several last-minute showstopper issues in
	&os;&nbsp;10.0, which lead to an extension in the final release
	builds.  &os;&nbsp;10.0-RELEASE was announced on January 20, two
	months behind the original schedule.</p>

      <p>The schedule for the &os;&nbsp;9.3-RELEASE cycle has been
	written and posted to the website, and the release cycle will
	begin early May.</p>

      <p>There is ongoing work to integrate support for embedded
	architectures as part of the release build process.  At this
	time, support exists for a number of ARM kernels, in particular
	the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and WandBoard.</p>

      <p>Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative,
	wide-spectrum, and object-oriented high-level computer
	programming language, extended from Pascal and other languages,
	originally targeted at embedded and real-time systems.  The
	number of Ada ports in the collection has grown significantly
	since the last report six months ago.  There are almost 50
	Ada-related ports now, with new ones getting added the time.</p>

      <p>The previous plan was to move from the GCC 4.7-based GNAT
	compiler to a GCC 4.8-based one, but finally GCC 4.8 was skipped
	and now a GCC 4.9-based GNAT is the standard Ada compiler, which
	fully supports the new ISO standard, Ada 2012.  Moving to a
	newer compiler allowed several important ports like PolyOrb and
	GPRBuild to be upgraded to the latest available versions.  In
	fact, almost every Ada port is currrently at its most recent
	upstream version.</p>

      <p>For non-Windows-based Ada development, &os; and DragonFly are
	now undisputed as the go-to platforms.  The other candidates are
	Debian and Fedora, but there are few Ada software on those
	platforms that are not also in &os; ports tree, but the versions are
	much older.  The Ports Collection also features software not found
	anywhere else such as the USAFA's Ironsides DNS server,
	libsparkcrypto, matreshka, GNATDroid (Android cross-compiler) and
	several developer libraries.</p>

      <p>A desired addition to the Ada ports will be SPARK 2014 (see
	links), which should cement &os; as an option for professional,
	safety-critical application development.  This package should
	have its first release by early summer.</p>

    <title>PCI SR-IOV Infrastructure</title>

      <p>PCI Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) is an optional part
	of the PCIe standard that provides hardware acceleration for the
	virtualization of PCIe devices.  When SR-IOV is in use, a
	function in a PCI device (known as a Physical Function, or PF)
	will present multiple Virtual PCI Functions (VF) on the PCI bus.
	These VFs are fully independent PCI devices that have
	 access to the resources of the PF.  For example, on a network
	interface card VFs could transmit and receive packets
	independent of the PF.</p>

      <p>The most obvious use case for SR-IOV is virtualization.  A
	hypervisor like bhyve could instantiate a VF for every VM and
	use PCI passthrough to assign the VFs to the VMs.  This would
	allow multiple VMs to share access to the PCI device without
	having to do any expensive communication with the hypervisor,
	greatly increasing performance of performing I/O from a VM.</p>

      <p>There are two parts to this project.  The first is implementing
	an API in the PCI subsystem for the creating VFs and configuring
	standard PCI features like BARs.  The second part is updating
	individual drivers for PCI devices that support SR-IOV to
	configure their VFs.  For example, a network interface driver
	will typically have to assign a MAC address to a VF and
	configure the interface to route packets destined for that MAC
	address to the VF.</p>

      <p>At this point only SR-IOV support for the <tt>ixgbe(4)</tt>
	driver is planned.  The PCI subsystem API is designed to be
	generic and should support SR-IOV on any device, but fairly
	extensive driver work is necessary to support SR-IOV, which is
	currently not planned due to lack of time and hardware.</p>

      <p>At present, <tt>ixgbe(4)</tt> is able to create VFs and the
	<tt>ixgbevf</tt> driver is able to pass traffic.  There is still
	a fair amount of work to support VLAN tags, multicast addresses
	and other features on the VFs.  Also, the VF configuration needs
	to be better integrated with the PF initialization path to
	ensure that resets of the PF do not interrupt operation of the
	VFs.</p>

      <p>The &os; Test Suite project aims to equip &os; with a
	comprehensive collection of tests that are easy to run out of

	suite is installed into <tt>/usr/tests/</tt> and the
	<tt>kyua(1)</tt> command-line tool (<tt>devel/kyua</tt> in the
	Ports Collection) is used to run them.  See the project page for
	more details.</p>

      <p>Since the last status report, we have been hard at work
	polishing the framework in many different areas.  The highlights
	are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A roadmap for the project has been prepared and published,
	  see links.</li>

	<li>Many tests have been added to the test suite thanks to the
	  work of various developers and, in particular, a good bunch of
	  old tests from <tt>src/tools/regression/</tt> have been
	  incorporated into the new test suite.  As of this writing,
	  there are 509 test cases continuously running.</li>

	<li>The testing infrastructure in <tt>stable/10</tt> branch has
	  been synced to <tt>head</tt>.  It should now be possible to
	  seamlessly MFC changes to the stable branch along with their
	  tests, if any.</li>

	<li>The testing cluster, which only issued <tt>amd64</tt>
	  builds, has been extended to perform <tt>i386</tt> builds as
	  well.  Additionally, a canary machine has been put in place so
	  that changes to the cluster configuration can be properly
	  validated before deployment.</li>

	<li>A tutorial on Kyua and the &os; Test Suite was given at
	  AsiaBSDCon 2014.  The tutorial materials are available for
	  public consumption, please consult the links.</li>

	<li>Both Kyua's and ATF's upstream sites have been moved to
	  GitHub, mostly due to the discontinuation of file downloads in
	  Google Code.</li>
      </ul>

    <help>
      <task>Enable the build of the test suite by default.</task>

      <task>Add alerting for failed or missing test runs from the

      <task>Simplify and improve Kyua HTML reports.  In particular,
	reports will be coalesced into single HTML files for easier
	management and will include more useful details for debugging.
	Such details are the revision at which the system was built,

      <p>Arm64 is the name of the in-progress port of &os; to the ARMv8
	CPU when it is in AArch64 mode.  Until recently, all ARM CPU
	designs were 32-bit only.  With the introduction of the ARMv8,
	architecture ARM has added a new 64-bit mode.  This new mode has
	been named AArch64.</p>

      <p>Progress has been good on getting &os; to build and run on the
	ARM Foundation model.  &os; is able to be built for this
	architecture, however it requires a number of external tools
	including <tt>objdump(1)</tt> and <tt>ld(1)</tt>.  These tools
	are provided by an external copy of binutils until replacements
	can be written.</p>

      <p>&os; will run the early boot on the Foundation model.  The
	loader has been ported to the AArch64 UEFI environment and can
	load and run the kernel.  The kernel is able to create the
	initial page tables to be able to run from virtual memory.  It
	can then execute C code to parse the memory map provided by the
	loader.  This is as far as the kernel currently boots.</p>

      <p>This work is now happening in the &os; Subversion repository in
	a project branch, see the links.</p>

      <p>&os; has been updated to allow it to use the VFP variant of the
	ARM EABI ABI.  The VFP unit is the ARM hardware to perform
	floating-point operations.  This changes the ABI to improve the
	performance of code that uses floating-point operations.  By
	default, &os; already uses the ARM EABI on all releases from
	10.0.</p>

      <p>This is important for users of &os;/arm with an ARMv6 or ARMv7
	SoC and who use code that makes use of floating-point
	operations.  It removes the need for the slow software
	floating-point support in <tt>libc</tt>.  This is mostly
	compatible with the existing ABI, with the exception of how
	floating-point values are passed into functions.  Because no
	floating-point values are passed to the kernel, the
	<tt>armv6</tt> and <tt>armv6hf</tt> kernels will work with
	either userland.</p>

      <p>As part of this, some support functions have been updated to
	use the VFP unit when available.  It is intended the existing
	<tt>armv6</tt> target architecture will be kept for cases where
	the SoC lacks a VFP unit, or existing binaries that are
	incompatible with the new ABI.</p>

      <p>The current Linux emulation layer relies on using a Linux base
	distribution along with Linux ports of relevant non-base
	software.  Fedora 10 has been imported in 2006, and it shows
	&mdash; current Linux software like Skype 4, Sublime Text 2, or
	even modern games fail to run with the provided libraries.</p>

      <p>CentOS 6.5 has been released in December 2013 and will be
	supported until 2017, thus making it an ideal basis for an
	update to the ports infrastructure.  Built upon the work of
	Carlos Jacobo Puga Medina, all ports using Linux has been
	updated to work with either Fedora 10 or CentOS 6.5.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project is to make CentOS 6.5 the default
	Linux distribution, so that &os; users can enjoy running modern
	Linux binaries without having to resort to proper virtualization
	à la VirtualBox, or even dual-booting.</p>

      <p>Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a computer
	security technique involved in protection from buffer overflow
	attacks.  In order to prevent an attacker from reliably jumping
	to a particular exploited function in memory, ASLR involves
	randomly arranging the positions of key data areas of a program,
	including the base of the executable and the positions of the
	stack, heap, and libraries, in a process' address space.</p>

      <p>We have added (a potentially buggy) ASLR support to all
	supported &os; architectures.  Focus is still on <tt>amd64</tt> as
	that is what the developers have access to.  We have added
	support for Position-Independent Executables (PIEs) in a number
	of applications in base.  We have identified a number of bugs
	and are actively working on targeting them.</p>

      <task>Shawn will be receiving a <tt>sparc64</tt> box on April 6,

      <task>Olivér has identified one or more bugs with the Linuxulator.

      <task>Shawn will be cleaning up code and adding more applications

      <p>The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) provides boot-
	and run-time services for x86 computers, and is a replacement
	for the legacy BIOS.  This project will adapt the &os; loader
	and kernel boot process for compatibility with UEFI firmware,
	found on contemporary servers, desktops, and laptops.</p>

      <p>Starting with &a.rpaulo;'s <tt>i386</tt> EFI loader, &a.benno;
	developed a working proof-of-concept <tt>amd64</tt> loader in 2013
	under sponsorship from the &os; Foundation.  After refinement,
	that work has now been merged from the <tt>projects/uefi</tt>
	Subversion branch into &os; <tt>head</tt>.  The project includes
	the infrastructure to build a UEFI-enabled loader, and the
	kernel-side changes to parse metadata provided by the
	loader.</p>

      <p>A number of integration tasks remain, with a plan to have UEFI
	installation and boot support merged to <tt>stable/10</tt> in
	time for &os; 10.1-RELEASE.</p>
