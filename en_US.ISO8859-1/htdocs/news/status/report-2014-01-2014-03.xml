      <p>Over the last four years the Chromium team has been busy with
	porting Chromium to &os;.  This involves patching the browser so
	that it runs on &os;, tracking and documenting security updates,
	and merging patches back upstream.</p>

      <p>While there are already several browsers available for &os;,
	advantages of Chromium are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Quick response from upstream to security issues, resulting
	  in approximately bi-weekly updates.</li>

	<li>A testbed for security features of &os;, like Capsicum.
	  While support for this capability and sandbox framework is
	  currently not included in the browser, a proof-of-concept
	  implementation for an early version of Chromium was realized
	  within a single weekend.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>George Liaskos and &a.rene; are currently busy with submitting
	the remaining patches specific to &os; back upstream.  Apart from
	making future updates easier, it sometimes also improves the
	overall code quality.</p>

      <p>&a.jonathan; recently updated the Capsicum patches for Chromium
	and is talking to upstream about them.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>Advocate &os;.  While patches are getting accepted by both
	humans and bots, it is not an official platform so attitude varies
	from developer to developer.  While &a.rene; thinks it is a bit
	early, it might be fruitful to investigate what is required to
	make &os; (and possibly OpenBSD) an official platform in terms
	of both hardware and procedures.</task>

      <task>If you feel comfortable with large source trees, you can try
	to build the Git version of Chromium on &os;.  If you are also
	comfortable with signing Googles Contributor License Agreement,
	you can join testing and submitting patches upstream.</task>

    <body>
      <p>ZFS is one of the premier features of &os;.  The current
	documentation in the Handbook and elsewhere online is severely
	lacking.  Much of the original documentation from Sun and Oracle
	has disappeared, moved, or is about the proprietary version of
	ZFS.</p>

      <p>New users have many questions about ZFS and yet there exists a
	great deal more bad advice about ZFS than proper documentation.
	The current ZFS chapter of the &os; Handbook starts off with the
	required steps to configure an i386 machine to run ZFS.  This is
	more likely to scare off a new user than to educate them about
	how to properly use ZFS.</p>

      <p>At BSDCan&nbsp;2013, the process of writing an entirely new
	chapter of the Handbook on ZFS was started.  Currently this
	chapter consists of approximately 16,000 words covering all
	subcommands of the <tt>zpool(8)</tt> and <tt>zfs(8)</tt>
	utilities, delegation, tuning and a section devoted to
	defintions and explainations of the terms and features of
	ZFS.</p>

      <p>The remaining section is the FAQ.  To help users address the
	most common problems they might run into with ZFS.  It would be
	useful to hear experiences, questions, misconceptions, gotchas,
	stumbling blocks and suggestions for the FAQ section from other
	users.  Also, a use cases section that highlights some of the
	cases where ZFS provides advantages over traditional file
	systems.</p>

      <p>Please send suggestions to the <tt>freebsd-doc</tt> mailing
	list.</p>

      <p>In early January, the &os; Release Engineering Team became
	aware of several last-minute showstopper issues in
	&os;&nbsp;10.0, which lead to an extension in the final release
	builds.  &os;&nbsp;10.0-RELEASE was announced on January 20, two
	months behind the original schedule.</p>

      <p>The schedule for the &os;&nbsp;9.3-RELEASE cycle has been
	written and posted to the website, and the release cycle will
	begin early May.</p>

      <p>There is ongoing work to integrate support for embedded
	architectures as part of the release build process.  At this
	time, support exists for a number of ARM kernels, in particular
	the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and WandBoard.</p>
