    </links>

    <body>
      <p>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a
	computer security technique that aids in mitigating
	low-level vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.
	ASLR randomizes the memory layout of running
	applications to prevent an attacker from knowing where
	a given exploitable vulnerability lies in memory.</p>

      <p>We have been working hard the last few months to ensure
	the robustness of our ASLR implementation. We have
	written a helpful manpage. We have updated the patch on
	FreeBSD's code review system (Phabricator).  Our ASLR
	implementation is in heavy use by the HardenedBSD team
	in production environments and is performing
	robustly.</p>

      <p>The next task is to compile the base system applications as
	Position-Independent Executables (PIEs). In order for
	ASLR to be effective, applications must be compiled as
	PIEs. It is likely that this part will take a long time
	to accomplish, given the complexity surrounding
	building the libraries in the base system. Even if applications
	are not compiled as PIEs, having ASLR available still
	helps those applications (like HardenedBSD's secadm)
	which force compilation as PIE for themselves.</p>

      <p>Xfce is a free software desktop environment for Unix and
	Unix-like platforms, such as &os;. It aims to be fast and
	lightweight, while still being visually appealing and easy to
	use.</p>

      <p>This quarter was an exciting time for the Xfce Team. We
	imported the Xfce desktop environment 4.12 into the ports
	tree, after more than two years of development.</p>

      <p>Overall, we have updated the following ports:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Xfce core (4.12)</li>
	<li>audio/xfce4-mpc-plugin (0.4.5)</li>
	<li>deskutils/xfce4-tumbler (0.1.31</li>
	<li>deskutils/xfce4-xkb-plugin (0.7.1)</li>
	<li>editors/mousepad (0.4.0)</li>

	<li>x11-fm/thunar (1.6.6)</li>
	<li>x11-themes/gtk-xfce-engine (3.2.0)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At the same time we switched to the USES framework, and a new
	plugin has been added, called
	<tt>audio/xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin</tt>.</p>

      <p>We also follow the unstable releases (available in our
	experimental repository) of:</p>

	<li>x11/xfce4-dashboard (0.3.91)</li>
	<li>x11/xfce4-notes-plugin (1.8.0 beta)</li>

      <p>The Lua boot loader project is in its final stage and
	it can be used on x86 already.  The aim of this project is to
	replace the Forth boot loader with a Lua boot loader.  All the
	scripts were re-written in Lua and are available in
	sys/boot/lua.  Once all the Forth features have been tested
	and once the boot menus look exactly like in Forth, we will
	start merging this project to &os; HEAD.  Both loaders can
	co-exist in the source tree with no problems because a
	pluggable loader functionality was introduced for this
	purpose.</p>

      <p>The project was initially started by Wojciech
	Koszek, and Pedro Souza wrote most of the Lua code last year in
	his Google Summer of Code project.</p>

    <body>
      <p>The project is to design a new KPI for network drivers
	that would allow for the network stack to evolve, without
	breaking compatibility with older drivers.  The core idea is to
	hide <tt>struct ifnet</tt> from drivers, thus the
	project has the name "opaque ifnet".  However, the
	project will include more changes than just hiding the
	struct's definition.</p>

      <p>At present, the new KPI has been prototyped, most
	important parts of network stack have been modified
	appropriately, and several drivers have been converted to new
	KPI.</p>

      <p>The project needs more manpower, since there are many
	network drivers in the tree, with a total of 245 sites where a
	struct ifnet is allocated.</p>

      <p>bhyve is a hypervisor that runs on the FreeBSD/amd64
	platform.  At present, it runs FreeBSD (8.x or later), Linux
	i386/x64, OpenBSD i386/amd64, and NetBSD/amd64 guests.  Current
	development is focused on enabling additional guest operating
	systems and implementing features found in other hypervisors.</p>

      <p>Peter Grehan did a status update at bhyvecon 2015 in
	Tokyo.  The slides are available at <a

      <p>Mihai Carabas presented the results of his GSoC project

      <p>A number of improvements were made to bhyve this quarter:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The RTC device model can now be instructed to keep UTC time
	  instead of localtime.  This is useful for guests like OpenBSD
	  that expect the RTC to keep UTC time.</li>
	<li>The virtio-blk device now does I/O asynchronously without
	  blocking the vcpu thread that initiated the I/O.</li>
	<li>The virtio-blk and ahci-hd devices are now able to execute
	  multiple I/O requests in parallel.  This can significantly
	  boost virtual disk throughput.</li>
	<li>The ahci-hd device emulation advertises TRIM to the guest
	  if the backend device supports it (e.g., ZVOL).</li>
	<li>The virtio-blk and ahci-hd devices now advertise the proper
	  logical and physical block size of the backend device or file.</li>

      <p>The Jenkins Continuous Integration and Testing
	project has been helping to improve the quality of &os;.
	Since the last status report, we have quickly found commits
	which caused build breakage or test failures.  &os; developers
	saw these problems and quickly fixed them.  Some of the
	highlights include:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><p>Ahmed Kamal agreed to join the jenkins-admin
	    team.  Even though he is not a &os; committer, he is
	    subscribed the the jenkins-admin alias, and is contributing
	    code via GitHub.  Ahmed has contributed mutiple SaltStack
	    scripts which are in the freebsd-ci GitHub repository.  Ahmed
	    has also found multiple bugs in SaltStack's &os; support.  He
	    has fixed these bugs and pushed them back to SaltStack via
	    GitHub pull requests.</p>
	  <p>Ahmed is a software developer who lives in
	    Cairo, Egypt.  He presently works for Cloud9ers, a cloud and
	    devops consulting firm.  In the past, he has worked for
	    Canonical as the Ubuntu Cloud and Server community liaison.</p>
	  <p>Ahmed found out about the Request for Help sent
	    out by &a.rodrigc; for help with Jenkins in &os; via a random
	    web search.  Ahmed found &os; to be a very nice project, and
	    was eager to volunteer and help out, and responded to the
	    Request.  Ahmed will attend BSDCan, where he will learn more
	    about the BSD Community.</p>
        </li>

	<li>&a.jmmv; extended Kyua to support executing test
	  cases in parallel.  This should help the scaling of testing in
	  environments with thousands of test cases.</li>

	<li>&a.rodrigc; got a commit bit to the Jenkins

    <body>
      <p>Just before the end of the quarter, we have updated
	clang, llvm and lldb in base to 3.6.0 release.  These all
	contain numerous improvements; please see the linked release
	notes for more detailed information.</p>

      <p>We have also imported a newer snapshot of compiler-rt,
	with better support for Address Sanitizer and Undefined
	Behavior Sanitizer, and arm64 runtime support routines.
	With the updated clang, llvm, and compiler-rt, we now support the
	Address and Undefined Behavior Sanitizers in the base system
	toolchain.</p>

      <p>Like the 3.5.0 release, these components require C++11
	support to build.  At this point, FreeBSD 10.0 and later
	provide that support, at least on x86.</p>

      <p>It is still unclear whether we will be able to MFC this
	to any stable branches, due to the difficulty it will
	introduce for upgrading from a system without C++11 support,
	either older releases or architectures still using gcc.</p>

      <p>In the lld-import branch, we have also imported a recent
	snapshot of lld, a linker produced by the LLVM project.  This
	is a very preliminary effort of making it available as a
	system linker.</p>

      <p>Thanks to Ed Maste, Roman Divacky, Andrew Turner and
	Davide Italiano for their help with this import, and thanks to
	Antoine Brodin for performing a ports exp-run.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>
	<p>After the ports exp-run, a small number of ports
	  turned out to have problems, and for almost all of these, PRs
	  with fixes or workarounds were filed.  While most of these PRs
	  have been processed and closed, there are still a few left
	  that need attention, from either the maintainer(s) or other
	  volunteers.</p>
      </task>

      <task>
	<p>Andrew Turner is working on bringing up the arm64
	  architecture, which is now fully supported in clang and llvm.
	  This will be a very interesting new area for solving
	  challenging problems.</p>
      </task>

      <task>
	<p>There are still issues with the powerpc and sparc64
	  architectures, and any help in these areas is very much
	  appreciated.</p>

      <p>The Foundation turned 15 on March 15th!  We kicked off
	our anniversary celebration by launching a spring fundraising
	campaign, to bring in 500 new community investors.  In
	conjunction with our anniversary, BSDNow interviewed Justin
	Gibbs about our history and plans for the future as part of
	the PC-BSD tour.  BSDNow also interviewed Ed Maste about &os;
	projects and processes in a "From the Foundation" episode.</p>

      <p>We were a Platinum Sponsor of AsiaBSDCon and had five team
	members attend the conference.  Kirk McKusick taught a two-day
	&os; kernel tutorial and gave a talk on Journaled Soft
	Updates and George Neville-Neil gave a talk on network
	performance in &os;; George also taught a two day tutorial
	(A Look Inside FreeBSD with DTrace).  This is from ongoing work
	with Robert Watson in support of both academic and
	practitioner educational material for &os;.  Dru gave a talk
	on Advanced OpenSource Storage with FreeNAS 9.3, and Ed Maste
	gave a talk on the LLDB Debugger in FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>We became a Platinum Sponsor for BSDCan, and have approved six
	travel grants to &os; contributors.  We also sponsored
	Michael Dexter to attend SCALE so he could give a talk on
	virtualization.</p>

      <p>In addition to the above conferences, we helped promote &os;
	at the following conferences:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast15">USENIX
	    FAST '15</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/">FOSDEM</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x/">SCALE</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>We received and published &os; testimonials from Xinuos,
	Netgate, and Tarsnap.</p>

      <p>We launched the "From the Trenches" series to provide stories
	from &os; contributors on what they are doing with &os;.
	Glen Barber wrote an article called ZFS and How to Make a Foot
	Cannon.  Glen also investigated a deadlock issue when rebooting
	after upgrades (PR 195458), and he released weekly 11-CURRENT and
	10-STABLE snapshot builds.</p>

      <p>The &os; Journal now has over 8300 subscribers and has a 98%
	renewal rate.  We are now publishing a few free <a
	  href="https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/journal/articles">&os;
	  Journal articles</a>.  We also created landing pages for each
	Journal issue for easier promotion.</p>

      <p>We started work on the Ottawa Vendor and Developer Summits and
	another one that has not yet been officially announced on the East
	Coast in the fall.</p>

      <p>Our development staff and project grant recipients were
	responsible for a large number of feature improvements and bug
	fixes over this past quarter.  We have eight individual reports
	in this quarterly update for Foundation-sponsored projects
	that demonstrate a number of different ways the Foundation
	supports the &os; project.</p>

      <p>One project is the subject of a research master's
	project at Swinburne University in Melbourne: the Multipath
	TCP (MPTCP) implementation for &os;.  The PCIe hot plug
	project is an individual project grant.  The FreeBSD/arm64
	project represents a collaborative development effort, where
	the Foundation facilitates a broader project with multiple
	participants.</p>

      <p>There are also a number of projects undertaken directly by
	Foundation staff.  In this quarterly report we have several
	reports in this category: Secure Boot, the autofs-based
	automount daemon, dynamically loadable libthr, Intel DMA
	remapping, migration to the ELF Tool Chain project tools.</p>

      <p>Additionally, one of the benefits of having long-term
	permanent staff is the ability to continue to maintain
	projects and contribute improvements beyond a fixed timeline.
	Over the last quarter Foundation staff contributed
	improvements to the UEFI boot process, vt(4) system console,
	in-kernel iSCSI stack, the virtual memory subsystem, and many
	others.</p>
