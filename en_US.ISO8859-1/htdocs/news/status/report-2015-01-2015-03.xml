    <body>
      <p>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a
	computer security technique that aids in mitigating
	low-level vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.
	ASLR randomizes the memory layout of running
	applications to prevent an attacker from knowing where
	a given exploitable vulnerability lies in memory.</p>

      <p>We have been working hard the last few months to ensure
	the robustness of our ASLR implementation. We have
	written a helpful manpage. We have updated the patch on
	FreeBSD's code review system (Phabricator).  Our ASLR
	implementation is in heavy use by the HardenedBSD team
	in production environments and is performing
	robustly.</p>

      <p>The next task is to compile the base system applications as
	Position-Independent Executables (PIEs). In order for
	ASLR to be effective, applications must be compiled as
	PIEs. It is likely that this part will take a long time
	to accomplish, given the complexity surrounding
	building the libraries in the base system. Even if applications
	are not compiled as PIEs, having ASLR available still
	helps those applications (like HardenedBSD's secadm)
	which force compilation as PIE for themselves.</p>
