    <body>
      <p>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a
	computer security technique that aids in mitigating
	low-level vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.
	ASLR randomizes the memory layout of running
	applications to prevent an attacker from knowing where
	a given exploitable vulnerability lies in memory.</p>

      <p>We have been working hard the last few months to ensure
	the robustness of our ASLR implementation. We have
	written a helpful manpage. We have updated the patch on
	FreeBSD's code review system (Phabricator).  Our ASLR
	implementation is in heavy use by the HardenedBSD team
	in production environments and is performing
	robustly.</p>

      <p>The next task is to compile the base system applications as
	Position-Independent Executables (PIEs). In order for
	ASLR to be effective, applications must be compiled as
	PIEs. It is likely that this part will take a long time
	to accomplish, given the complexity surrounding
	building the libraries in the base system. Even if applications
	are not compiled as PIEs, having ASLR available still
	helps those applications (like HardenedBSD's secadm)
	which force compilation as PIE for themselves.</p>

      <p>Xfce is a free software desktop environment for Unix and
	Unix-like platforms, such as &os;. It aims to be fast and
	lightweight, while still being visually appealing and easy to
	use.</p>

      <p>This quarter was an exciting time for the Xfce Team. We
	imported the Xfce desktop environment 4.12 into the ports
	tree, after more than two years of development.</p>

      <p>Overall, we have updated the following ports:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Xfce core (4.12)</li>
	<li>audio/xfce4-mpc-plugin (0.4.5)</li>
	<li>deskutils/xfce4-tumbler (0.1.31</li>
	<li>deskutils/xfce4-xkb-plugin (0.7.1)</li>
	<li>editors/mousepad (0.4.0)</li>
	<li>graphics/ristretto (0.8.0)</li>
	<li>multimedia/xfce4-parole (0.8.0)</li>
	<li>sysutils/garcon (0.4.0)</li>
	<li>sysutils/xfce4-diskperf-plugin (2.5.5)</li>
	<li>sysutils/xfce4-fsguard-plugin (1.0.2)</li>
	<li>sysutils/xfce4-power-manager (1.4.4)</li>
	<li>sysutils/xfce4-wavelan-plugin (0.5.12)</li>
	<li>textproc/xfce4-dict-plugin (0.7.1)</li>
	<li>www/xfce4-smartbookmark-plugin (0.4.6)</li>
	<li>x11/libexo (0.10.4)</li>
	<li>x11-clocks/xfce4-timer-out-plugin (1.0.2)</li>
	<li>x11-fm/thunar (1.6.6)</li>
	<li>x11-themes/gtk-xfce-engine (3.2.0)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At the same time we switched to the USES framework, and a new
	plugin has been added, called
	<tt>audio/xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin</tt>.</p>

      <p>We also follow the unstable releases (available in our
	experimental repository) of:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>x11/xfce4-dashboard (0.3.91)</li>
	<li>x11/xfce4-notes-plugin (1.8.0 beta)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The following documentation patches are ready:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=197878">PR197878</a>,
	  Update Xfce section in Porter's Handbook</li>
	<li><a href="https://reviews.freebsd.org/D1305">D1305</a>, FAQ</li>
      </ul>

      <task>
	<p>Add a new property (through xfconf-query) in order to
	  allow users to change the greyscale value of quicklaunch
	  icons in x11/xfce4-dashboard (this feature is only available
	  in the unstable release).</p>
