    </links>

    <body>
      <p>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a
	computer security technique that aids in mitigating
	low-level vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.
	ASLR randomizes the memory layout of running
	applications to prevent an attacker from knowing where
	a given exploitable vulnerability lies in memory.</p>

      <p>We have been working hard the last few months to ensure
	the robustness of our ASLR implementation. We have
	written a helpful manpage. We have updated the patch on
	FreeBSD's code review system (Phabricator).  Our ASLR
	implementation is in heavy use by the HardenedBSD team
	in production environments and is performing
	robustly.</p>

      <p>The next task is to compile the base system applications as
	Position-Independent Executables (PIEs). In order for
	ASLR to be effective, applications must be compiled as
	PIEs. It is likely that this part will take a long time
	to accomplish, given the complexity surrounding
	building the libraries in the base system. Even if applications
	are not compiled as PIEs, having ASLR available still
	helps those applications (like HardenedBSD's secadm)
	which force compilation as PIE for themselves.</p>

      <p>Xfce is a free software desktop environment for Unix and
	Unix-like platforms, such as &os;. It aims to be fast and
	lightweight, while still being visually appealing and easy to
	use.</p>

      <p>This quarter was an exciting time for the Xfce Team. We
	imported the Xfce desktop environment 4.12 into the ports
	tree, after more than two years of development.</p>

      <p>Overall, we have updated the following ports:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Xfce core (4.12)</li>
	<li>audio/xfce4-mpc-plugin (0.4.5)</li>
	<li>deskutils/xfce4-tumbler (0.1.31</li>
	<li>deskutils/xfce4-xkb-plugin (0.7.1)</li>
	<li>editors/mousepad (0.4.0)</li>
	<li>graphics/ristretto (0.8.0)</li>
	<li>multimedia/xfce4-parole (0.8.0)</li>
	<li>sysutils/garcon (0.4.0)</li>
	<li>sysutils/xfce4-diskperf-plugin (2.5.5)</li>
	<li>sysutils/xfce4-fsguard-plugin (1.0.2)</li>
	<li>sysutils/xfce4-power-manager (1.4.4)</li>
	<li>sysutils/xfce4-wavelan-plugin (0.5.12)</li>
	<li>textproc/xfce4-dict-plugin (0.7.1)</li>
	<li>www/xfce4-smartbookmark-plugin (0.4.6)</li>
	<li>x11/libexo (0.10.4)</li>
	<li>x11-clocks/xfce4-timer-out-plugin (1.0.2)</li>
	<li>x11-fm/thunar (1.6.6)</li>
	<li>x11-themes/gtk-xfce-engine (3.2.0)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At the same time we switched to the USES framework, and a new
	plugin has been added, called
	<tt>audio/xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin</tt>.</p>

      <p>We also follow the unstable releases (available in our
	experimental repository) of:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>x11/xfce4-dashboard (0.3.91)</li>
	<li>x11/xfce4-notes-plugin (1.8.0 beta)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The following documentation patches are ready:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=197878">PR197878</a>,
	  Update Xfce section in Porter's Handbook</li>

    <body>
      <p>The Lua boot loader project is in its final stage and
	it can be used on x86 already.  The aim of this project is to
	replace the Forth boot loader with a Lua boot loader.  All the
	scripts were re-written in Lua and are available in
	sys/boot/lua.  Once all the Forth features have been tested
	and once the boot menus look exactly like in Forth, we will
	start merging this project to &os; HEAD.  Both loaders can
	co-exist in the source tree with no problems because a
	pluggable loader functionality was introduced for this
	purpose.</p>

      <p>The project was initially started by Wojciech
	Koszek, and Pedro Souza wrote most of the Lua code last year in
	his Google Summer of Code project.</p>

      <p>To build a Lua boot loader just use:</p>

      <p>The &os; storage books are proceeding slower than expected.
	This is a complex project.</p>

      <p>It appears that ZFS will be a two-book topic. The
	first book will cover basic ZFS, while the second will cover
	advanced cases like live and cold replication, sharing,
	performance, and using ZFS on top of less common GEOM
	providers.  More details can be found in the links section.</p>

      <p>Allan Jude (allanjude@) is co-authoring the ZFS
	books.  Little did he know of the magnitude of the task
	ahead of him when he signed up....</p>

      <p>The project is to design a new KPI for network drivers
	that would allow for the network stack to evolve, without
	breaking compatibility with older drivers.  The core idea is to
	hide <tt>struct ifnet</tt> from drivers, thus the
	project has the name "opaque ifnet".  However, the
	project will include more changes than just hiding the
	struct's definition.</p>

      <p>At present, the new KPI has been prototyped, most
	important parts of network stack have been modified
	appropriately, and several drivers have been converted to new
	KPI.</p>

      <p>The project needs more manpower, since there are many
	network drivers in the tree, with a total of 245 sites where a
	struct ifnet is allocated.</p>
