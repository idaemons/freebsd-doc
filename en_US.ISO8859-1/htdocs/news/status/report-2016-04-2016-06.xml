      <p>The &os; Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
	and publishing release schedules for official project releases
	of &os;, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
	respective branches, among other things.</p>

      <p>The &os; Release Engineering Team completed the 10.3-RELEASE
	cycle late April, led by &a.marius;.  The release was one week
	behind the original schedule, to accommodate for a few last
	minute critical issues that were essential to include in the
	final release.</p>

      <p>The &os;&nbsp;11.0-RELEASE cycle started late May, one month
	behind the orignal schedule.  The schedule slip was primarily
	to accommodate for packaging the &os; base system with the
	<tt>pkg(8)</tt> utility.  However, as work on this progressed,
	it became apparent that there were too many outstanding
	issues.  As a result, packaged base will be a "beta" feature
	for 11.0-RELEASE, with the goal of promoting it to a
	first-class feature in 11.1-RELEASE, with additional
	provisions to ensure a seamless transition for earlier
	supported releases.</p>

      <p>Despite the fact that packaged base is not going to be a
	prime feature for &os;&nbsp;11.0-RELEASE, the Release
	Engineering Team would like to thank everyone who tested,
	provided patches, provided ideas and feedback, and in some
	cases, shot themselves in the foot due to bugs.</p>

    <title>Obsoleting Rails 3</title>

      <p>Ruby on Rails is the base for most of the rubygems in the
	Ports Collection.  Currently, versions 3.2 and 4.2 coexist.
	Since Rails 3.2 is running out of support, the time has
	come to switch to 4.2.</p>

      <p>While there is ongoing progress to remove Rails 3.2 from
	the ports tree, there are some major updates blocking this
	process.  The most recent blocker was the outstanding update
	of <tt>www/redmine</tt> from 2.6 to 3.2. This has completed
	successfully, so we can now move on.</p>

      <p>To help with porting or testing, feel free to contact me or
	the <tt>ruby@FreeBSD.org</tt> mailing list.</p>
