    <body>
      <p>The &os; Test Suite project aims to equip &os; with a
	comprehensive test suite that is easy to run out of the box and
	during the development of the system.  The test suite is
	installed into <tt>/usr/tests/</tt> and the <tt>kyua(1)</tt>
	command-line tool (<tt>devel/kyua</tt> in the Ports Collection)
	is used to run them.</p>

      <p>The benefits of having a test suite that is easy to use and
	continuously run are obvious: regressions can be caught sooner
	rather than later and the Release Engineering Team can better
	assess the quality of the tree before deciding to cut a release.
	Additionally, and because we choose to install the tests, we
	also allow any end user to perform sanity checks on new
	installations of the system on his or her particular hardware
	configuration &mdash; a very attractive thing to do when
	deploying production servers.</p>

      <p>During the last few months, we have added the necessary pieces to
	the build system to support building and installing test programs of
	various kinds. To demonstrate the functionality of these, some test
	programs were added and others were migrated from the old testing tree
	in <tt>tools/regression/</tt> to the new layout for tests.</p>

      <p>The current test suite should be seen as a proof of concept at this
	point: it is only composed of a small set of test programs and the goal
	is to get the infrastructure in place before mass-migrating existing
	test code and/or importing external tests.</p>

      <p>As part of this work, two new releases of Kyua were published.
	Of special interest is the addition of a TAP-compliant backend so
	that existing tests from <tt>tools/regression/</tt> can be
	plugged into the test suite with minimum effort.</p>

      <p>As of December 31st, the basic continuous testing
	infrastructure is up and running, see the links section for the
	home page.  For further information, please see the related
	announcement and blog post on the subject (also in the links
	section).</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>We have three machines for the test cluster.  At the
	moment, only one of them is in use to continuously test amd64 on
	both <tt>head</tt> and <tt>stable/10</tt>.  We need to figure
	out the right level of parallelization to put other machines to
	use &mdash; but a first easy cut may be to just test different
	architectures (with the help of QEMU).</task>

      <task>Related to the above, the Kyua reporting engine needs
	significant tuning to make the reports nice and clean.  Ideally,
	Kyua should be able to coalesce results from different runs into
	a single location and generate cohesive reports out of them.
	Fixing this is a high priority.</task>

      <task>A tutorial on writing tests for &os; has been proposed for
	AsiaBSDCon&nbsp;2014.  The outcome of the proposal is still
	unknown, but stay tuned!</task>

      <task>Port, port, and port more tests to the new test suite.  A
	test suite is worthless if it does not validate stuff.  Stay tuned
	for a request for help once we have put all basic pieces in
	place and have streamlined the migration process.</task>

      <p>Cubieboard is a single-board computer, based on the AllWinner
	A10 SoC, popular on cheap tablets, phones and media PCs.  The
	second version enhances the board mainly by replacing the
	AllWinner A10 SoC with an AllWinner A20 which contains 2 ARM
	Cortex-A7 MPCore CPUs and 2 Mali-400 GPUs (Mali-400MP2).  In the
	last few months, work has continued on their &os; port, and
	some work was done on the EMAC 10/100 Ethernet driver (see
	link).  The driver is now in a good shape, however the RX side
	is very slow and there is need to have an external DMA driver that
	can be used in this case.</p>

      <p>Rockchip is a series of SoC (System on Chip) integrated
	circuits that are mainly for embedded systems applications in
	mobile entertainment devices such as smartphones, tablets, e-books,
	set-top boxes, media players, personal video, and MP3 players.
	Due to their evolution from the MP3/MP4 player market, most
	Rockchip ICs feature advanced media decoding logic but lack
	integrated cellular radio basebands.  Initial support for the
	Rockchip RK3188 (Quad core Cortex A9) SoC is committed to
	<tt>head</tt>.  Now &os; runs on Radxa Rock and it supports
	the following peripherals:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Existing DWC OTG driver in host mode</li>
	<li>GPIO</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some work was also done on initial support for the Qualcomm
	Snapdragon S4 SoC, featuring the Krait CPU, which is considered
	a "platform" for use in smartphones, tablets, and smartbook
	devices.  Krait has many similarities with the ARM Cortex-A15
	CPU and is also based on the ARMv7 instruction set.  A minimal
	console driver was written, and &os;'s early boot messages can
	be now seen on the serial console.  The timer driver works too,
	and the boot now stops at the mountroot prompt.</p>

      <p>Xfce is a free software desktop environment for Unix and
	Unix-like platforms, such as &os;.  It aims to be fast and
	lightweight, while still being visually appealing and easy to
	use.  The &os; Xfce Team has kept most of Xfce ports up-to-date,
	while fixed many issues along the way in this quarter.</p>

      <p>Currently, the following components with the following versions
	are available:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Applications:</li>

	<ul>
	  <li>Orage (4.10.0)</li>
	  <li>Midori (0.5.6)</li>
	  <li>xfce4-terminal (0.6.3)</li>
	  <li>xfce4-parole (0.5.3, 0.5.4)</li>
	</ul>

	<li>Panel plugins:</li>

	<ul>
	  <li>xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin (1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.3.0)</li>
	  <li>xfce4-mailwatch-plugin (1.2.0)</li>
	  <li>xfce4-wmdock-plugin (0.6.0)</li>
	</ul>
      </ul>

      <p>We helped Midori's upstream to switch from Waf (Python script)
	to CMake.  Xfce now also supports Gtk2, Gtk3, and the new
	WebKitGtk API, available from the 2.x branch, not present in our
	ports tree at the moment, though.  Most of the ports now use
	stage directories, with only some plugins left to convert.</p>

      <p>We also removed obsolete ports:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><tt>x11-themes/lila-xfwm4</tt> (Xfwm4 theme)</li>
	<li><tt>multimedia/xfce4-media</tt> (multimedia player)</li>
	<li><tt>net-im/xfce4-messenger-plugin</tt></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Besides, we followed the development of the Xfce core
	components and Parole closely.  See the links for documentation
	on how to upgrade those libraries.</p>

    <body>
      <p>The performance of ZFS and NFS was suboptimal in &os;, so we
	have recently investigated some possible improvement paths.  The
	<tt>uma(9)</tt> memory allocator caching code was improved to
	adapt better to system memory constraints.  Combined with other
	virtual memory subsystem improvements done in the previous
	years, it should be safe to actively use <tt>uma(9)</tt> caches
	now.  Their use in ZFS for ZIO/ARC may be enabled via the
	<tt>vfs.zfs.zio.use_uma</tt> <tt>loader(8)</tt> tunable, which
	is now the default for amd64, where it is recommended.  Use of
	<tt>uma(9)</tt> caches for LZ4 compression buffers is
	unconditionally enabled on all architectures as it is has no
	serious drawbacks.  On systems with many CPUs, these changes
	doubled the performance in the benchmarks.</p>

      <p>Several areas of the NFS server stack (RPC, FHA, DRC) got a
	number of fixes and performance optimizations that significantly
	improve performance and reduce the CPU usage in a number of
	tests.  Together with the ZFS memory allocator changes mentioned
	above, it was possible to reach 200K NFS block read IOPS and 55K
	SPEC NFS IOPS.</p>

      <p>The code was committed to <tt>head</tt>.  The <tt>uma(9)</tt>
	ZFS commits have been already merged to <tt>stable/10</tt>, and

      <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming
	language.  For many operating systems, Python is a standard
	component; it ships with &os; as well.  A lot of progress has
	been made around the &os; Python ports in the last quarter.</p>

      <p>The <tt>devel/py-distribute</tt> port has been replaced by the
	refreshed <tt>devel/py-setuptools</tt> port, which comes with a
	lot of features that simplify the ways of installing Python
	packages.  The change also led us to install everything through
	Setuptools now, which resembles a PyIP a bit and allows us to
	perform some major cleanup on the distutils installation
	behaviour.</p>

      <p>The implicit <tt>lang/python</tt> build and run-time dependency
	was removed from the ports infrastructure.  Every port now
	depends on a specific Python version or on the
	<tt>lang/python</tt> metaport.  This prevents compatibility
	issues for ports that depend on Python&nbsp;2.x OR
	Python&nbsp;3.x exclusively, but use the <tt>python</tt>
	command, which might point to a version of incompatible user
	choice.</p>

      <p>The <tt>lang/python27</tt> port was updated to version 2.7.6,
	and the <tt>lang/python33</tt> port was updated to version
	3.3.3, and the <tt>lang/pypy</tt> port was updated to version
	2.2.1</p>

      <p>We are currently working on the necessary infrastructure quirks
	to support different Python versions for the same port.  Most of
	the work has been done and needs to be tested before it can be
	integrated.</p>

      <p>OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools
	of compute, storage, and networking resources in a data center.
	OpenContrail is a network virtualization (SDN) solution
	comprising network controller, virtual router and analytics
	engine, which can be integrated with cloud orchestration systems
	like OpenStack or CloudStack.</p>

      <p>The goal of this work is to enable &os; as a fully supported
	compute host for OpenStack, using OpenContrail virtualized
	networking.  The main areas of development are the
	following:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>OpenStack compute driver (<tt>nova-compute</tt>) for the
	  &os; <tt>bhyve(4)</tt> hypervisor.</li>

	<li>OpenContrail vRouter (forwarding-plane kernel module) port
	  to &os;.</li>

	<li>Integration, performance optimizations.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The current state of development features a working demo of
	OpenStack with compute node components running on a &os; host:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The native <tt>bhyve(4)</tt> hypervisor is driven by a
	  <tt>nova-compute</tt> component for spawning guest instances
	  and a <tt>nova-network</tt> component for providing simple
	  networking between those guests.</li>

	<li>The <tt>nova-network</tt> approach (based on local host
	  bridging) is becoming an obsolete technology in OpenStack and
	  was used here only for a demonstration and proof-of-concept
	  purposes, without exploring all the possible features.</li>

	<li>The main objective is to move to OpenContrail-based
	  networking, therefore become compliant with the modern OpenStack
	  networking API ("neutron").</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) provides boot-
	and run-time services for x86 computers, and is a replacement for
	the legacy BIOS.  This project will adapt the &os; loader and
	kernel boot process for compatibility with UEFI firmware, found
	on contemporary servers, desktops, and laptops.</p>

      <p>In 2013, The &os; Foundation sponsored Benno Rice for a short
	project to improve the UEFI bootloader.  This resulted in a
	working proof-of-concept in the UEFI project branch, but it was
	not ready to be merged to &os; <tt>head</tt>.</p>

      <p>Ed Maste has taken that original work and, with review feedback
	from Konstantin Belousov, been preparing it for integration into
	&os; <tt>head</tt>.  Some changes have been merged to
	<tt>head</tt> already.  The rest will be merged as they are
	refined.</p>

      <p>Intel provided a motherboard and CPU for the project, which

    <body>
      <p>GNOME is a desktop environment and graphical user interface
	that runs on top of a computer operating system.  GNOME is part
	of the GNU Project and can be used with various Unix-like
	operating systems, including &os;.</p>

      <p>In this quarter, MATE&nbsp;1.6 was finally imported into the
	Ports Collection, thanks to the efforts of Jeremy Messenger.
	MATE is a desktop environment forked from the now-unmaintained
	code base of GNOME&nbsp;2, therefore it is basically a
	replacement for GNOME&nbsp;2.  It recommended for users wanting
	to keep GNOME&nbsp;2 as their desktop to switch as GNOME&nbsp;2
	will be replaced by GNOME&nbsp;3 in the near future.  This
	switch will be announced in advance, so people will have time to
	move to MATE if they have not already.  The complete MATE-based
	desktop environment can be installed via the <tt>x11/mate</tt>
	port, or, for a minimal install, <tt>x11/mate-base</tt>.</p>

      <p>Our home page is quite out of date.  An update for it for
	GNOME&nbsp;3.6 is underway.  Part of this update is rewriting
	and updating the old GNOME porting guide as a chapter of the
	Porter's Handbook.</p>

      <p>Another major task required for getting a bleeding-edge GNOME
	build on &os; mostly out-of-the box is moving to JHbuild with
	some custom rules.  This is done to find and fix compile issues
	on other BSDs more quickly.</p>
