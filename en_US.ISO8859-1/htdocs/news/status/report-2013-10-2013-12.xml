      <p>CBSD is another &os; jail management solution, aimed at
	combining various features, such as <tt>racct(8)</tt>,
	<tt>vnet</tt>, <tt>zfs(8)</tt>, <tt>carp(4)</tt>,
	<tt>hastd(8)</tt>, into a single tool.  This provides a more
	comprehensive way for building application servers using
	pre-installed jails with a typical set of software, and requires
	a minimal effort to configure.</p>
