    <body>
      <p>Currently, &os; is well proven as a base for routers
	(<strong>pfSense</strong>, <strong>OPNSense</strong>,
	<strong>BSDRP</strong>) and NAS (<strong>FreeNAS</strong>,
	<strong>zfsGuru</strong>, <strong>Nas4Free</strong>).  However,
	&os;-based solutions are almost completely absent in the
	virtualization area, and <strong>ClonOS</strong> is one of the
	attempts to change it.
      </p>

      <p>ClonOS is a new free open-source &os;-based platform for virtual
	environment creation and management.  In the core platform are:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>&os; as the host OS</li>
	
	<li><a href="http://man.FreeBSD.org/bhyve/8">bhyve</a></li>

	<li><a href="https://www.xenproject.org/">xen</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://man.freebsd.org/vale/4">vale</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://man.freebsd.org/jail/8">jail</a></li>

	<li><a href="https://www.bsdstore.ru/">CBSD</a> (as a management
	  tool)</li>

	<li><a href="https://puppet.com/">puppet</a> (for configuration
	  management)</li>

	<li>additional features such as go-micro services (obtaining
	  VMs, resizing disks and so on)</li>
      </ul>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>We would like to see ClonOS in real-world use.  In this
	regard we are interested in finding more people and companies who
	used &os; in hosting tasks.  In addition, it could be great to
	work with the developers of existing NAS solutions (zfsGuru,
	Nas4Free)
