	importing ioat(4)</url>
    </links>

    <body>
      <p>A new driver, ioat(4), was added to the tree.  ioat(4)
	supports Intel's I/O Acceleration Technology devices which are found
	on some Intel server systems.</p>

      <p>These devices are DMA offload engines, which can accelerate
	some I/O-heavy applications by offloading memory copies from the main
	CPU to the I/OAT unit.  This acceleration is not transparent;
	applications must be adapted to take advantage of the hardware.</p>

      <p>Some I/OAT models support more advanced copying modes, like
	XOR; these modes are not yet supported in the ioat(4) driver.</p>

      <p>IPSEC is now enabled by default in the GENERIC kernel
	configuration, and work is proceeding to speed things up in various
	ways.  The latest changes are the addition, by &a.jmg;, &a.eri;, and
	&a.gnn;, of AES modes both in hardware and in software.  Part of this
	work also includes more benchmarks undertaken using Conductor in the
	netperf project.  Results have been reported at BSDCan and vBSDCon
	with more to come at EuroBSD and BSDBrasil.

    <body>
      <p>With the advent of DTrace we are able to replace many of
	the internal kernel debugging options, such as TCPDEBUG,
	with statically defined tracepoints (SDTs).  Tracepoints have now
	been added to the system that replicate the functionality of the
	TCPDEBUG kernel option.  No new kernel options need to be added
	&mdash; they are standard with any kernel that has DTrace, which
	is included in the default GENERIC kernels in 10.x and HEAD.
