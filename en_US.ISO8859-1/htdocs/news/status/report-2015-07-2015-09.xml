    <body>
      <p>A new driver, ioat(4), was added to the tree.  ioat(4)
	supports Intel's I/O Acceleration Technology devices which are found
	on some Intel server systems.</p>

      <p>These devices are DMA offload engines, which can accelerate
	some I/O-heavy applications by offloading memory copies from the main
	CPU to the I/OAT unit.  This acceleration is not transparent;
	applications must be adapted to take advantage of the hardware.</p>

      <p>Some I/OAT models support more advanced copying modes, like
	XOR; these modes are not yet supported in the ioat(4) driver.</p>

      <p>IPSEC is now enabled by default in the GENERIC kernel
	configuration, and work is proceeding to speed things up in various
	ways.  The latest changes are the addition, by &a.jmg;, &a.eri;, and
	&a.gnn;, of AES modes both in hardware and in software.  Part of this
	work also includes more benchmarks undertaken using Conductor in the
	netperf project.  Results have been reported at BSDCan and vBSDCon
	with more to come at EuroBSD and BSDBrasil.

      <p>With the advent of DTrace we are able to replace many of
	the internal kernel debugging options, such as TCPDEBUG,
	with statically defined tracepoints (SDTs).  Tracepoints have now
	been added to the system that replicate the functionality of the
	TCPDEBUG kernel option.  No new kernel options need to be added
	&mdash; they are standard with any kernel that has DTrace, which
	is included in the default GENERIC kernels in 10.x and HEAD.

    </links>

    <body>
      <p>The Acer C720 Chromebook is an affordable (under $200) and
	powerful little laptop, that provides a battery life of up to six
	hours running FreeBSD.  It is a great machine for travelling and
	coding in general.  The machine is fully functional, meaning that
	all essential devices work: Keyboard, trackpad, light sensor,
	backlight control, display in VESA mode (fast), external Display
	on HDMI (only VESA mirror mode), sound, USB ports, SD card slot,
	camera and Atheros Wireless.</p>

      <p>This quarter, this project extended previous work on the
	boot process and keyboard driver as well as the smbus(4) driver.
	It added three new drivers: ig4(4), cyapa(4) and isl(4).</p>

      <p>Much of the development was originally done in late 2014;
	since then, the patches have been massively improved and merged
	into CURRENT, so that all relevant devices work without manual
	patching.</p>

      <p>For those who are unable to run CURRENT, there is a
	backported patch to 10.2-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>Thanks to everyone who helped in the process, I couldn't
	have done it without you (you know who you are).

    <body>
      <p>This project aims to add support for the LiquidIO family
	of high-performance programmable accellerator 10/40-gigabit
	Ethernet network adapters.  The currently developed kernel driver
	supports CN6640- and CN6880-based PCIe cards, enabling the
	following features:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A CNNIC API for controlling/interacting with the smart NIC
	  from user and kernel space including:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Handling multiple concurrent applications running on the
	      same device</li>
	    <li>Request/reply mechanism for (a)synchronous
	      ordered/unordered communication</li>
	    <li>Remote memory operations</li>
	    <li>Device shutdown/reset</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>A basic NIC module utilizing the CNNIC API and a
	  Cavium-provided NIC firmware.  This module provides:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Single/multi-queue TX</li>
	    <li>Hardware TCP/UDP checksum offloading</li>
	    <li>Large Receive Offload</li>
	    <li>Promiscous mode</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Sysctl-based device statistics and configuration view</li>
	<li>Custom firmware loading via user-built modules and
	  &os;'s firmware(9) mechanism.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The project is currently being developed in house and is
	currently being prepared for upstream.  We plan on making it
	available in &os; 11.</p>

	the x86 architectures.  We managed to bring up a &os; guest up to
	the point of initializing interrupts.  There is still work to be

	porting to a real hardware platform (Cubie2).

      <p>GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager with many

	and Alibaba.  It also is a very long-standing entry on the
	&quot;Wanted Ports&quot; list on the &os; Wiki.</p>

      <p>In the last month there was steady progress, which finally
	resulted in the PR for adding the new port.  In addition to the
	many dependencies &a.pgollucci; is working on, there was already a
	large amount of work done.  In addition to  many new or updated
	rubygems, Rails 4.1 was resurrected.  Many committers were
	involved in the process and guided us through the various problems
	and pitfalls.</p>

      <p>Because of the number of dependencies &mdash; we nearly hit
	100 &mdash; making progress takes some time.  In the meantime,
	there is already a new major version of GitLab released, which
	requires even more dependencies and updates.  Work on this version
	is already in progress, but the first goal is to get the latest
	stable version from the 7.14 branch into the ports tree.
