    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>This report covers &os;-related projects between April and
      June 2014.  This is the second of four reports planned for
      2014.</p>

    <?ignore
    <p>The first quarter of 2014 was, again, a hectic and
      productive time for &os;.  The Ports team released their
      landmark first quarterly <q>stable</q> branch.  &os; continues
      to grow on the ARM architecture, now running on an ARM-based
      ChromeBook. SMP is now possible on multi-core ARM systems.
      bhyve, the native &os; hypervisor, continues to improve.  An
      integral test suite is taking shape, and the Jenkins Continuous
      Integration system has been implemented.  &os; patches to GCC
      are being <q>forward-ported</q>, and LLDB, the Clang/LLVM
      debugger is being ported. Desktop use has also seen
      improvements, with work on Gnome, KDE, Xfce, KMS video drivers,
      X.org, and <tt>vt</tt>, the new console driver which supports
      KMS and Unicode.  Linux and Wine binary compatibility layers
      have been improved.  UEFI booting support has been merged to
      head. The &os; Foundation continues to assist in moving &os;
      forward, sponsoring conferences and meetings and numerous
      development projects.  And these are only some of the things
      that happened! Read on for even more.</p>
    ?>

    <p>Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work!  This
      report contains 1 entry and we hope you enjoy reading it.</p>

    <p>The deadline for submissions covering between July and
      September 2014 is October 7th, 2014.</p>

      <p>The so-called "CUSE4BSD" has been imported into the base
	system of &os;-11.  CUSE is short for character device in
	userspace.  The CUSE library is a wrapper for the devfs(8)
	kernel functionality which is exposed through /dev/cuse.  In
	order to function the CUSE kernel code must either be enabled
	in the kernel configuration file or loaded separately as
	a module.  Follow the commit message link to get more
	information.
