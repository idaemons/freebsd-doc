      <p>This report covers work since the last &os;/EC2 status report
	(2015Q1).</p>

      <p>&os;/EC2 is now part of the regular &os; release build,
	with snapshots and releases being automatically uploaded and
	copied to all available regions.  Due to legal restrictions
	this does not currently include the GovCloud or China
	(Beijing) regions; anyone wishing to use &os; in those regions
	is encouraged to contact the author.</p>

      <p>The AWS Marketplace reports that approximately 800 users
	are running roughly 2000 &os; EC2 instances.  This does not
	count the likely significantly larger number of EC2 instances
	launched "directly" through the EC2 API and Console, but at
	least places a lower bound on usage.</p>

      <p>&os; 11.0-RELEASE shipped with support for the "enhanced
	networking" support in EC2 C3, C4, R3, I2, D2, and M4
	(excluding m4.16xlarge) instances; this provides significantly
	higher network performance than the virtual networking
	available on older EC2 instances and with older versions of
	&os;.</p>

      <p>&os; 11.0-RELEASE and later also use indirect segment disk
	I/Os, which yield ~20% higher throughput with equal or lower
	latency, and support the 128-vCPU x1.32xlarge instance
	type.</p>

      <p> &os; now supports the Amazon Simple Systems Manager service
	(&quot;run command&quot;).</p>

    <body>
      <p>Prometheus is an Open Source monitoring system that was
	originally built at SoundCloud in 2012.  Since 2016, this project is
	part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, together with other
	projects like Kubernetes.</p>

      <p>Prometheus scrapes its targets by periodically sending HTTP GET
	requests.  Targets then respond by sending key-value pairs of metrics
	and their sample value.  Prometheus has a query language, PromQL,
	that can be used to aggregate sample values and specify alerting
	conditions.  Tools like Grafana can be used to create fancy
	dashboards using such queries.</p>

      <p>The Prometheus project provides a utility called the
	node_exporter that gathers basic system metrics and serves them
	over HTTP.  This utility tends to be rather complex, as it has
	to extract metrics from many different sources.  On Linux, files
	in <tt>/proc</tt> have no uniform format, meaning that for every
	kernel framework a custom collector needs to be written.</p>

      <p>On &os; the sitiuation is better, as the data exported
	through <tt>sysctl</tt> is already structured in such a way that
	it can easily be translated to Prometheus' metrics format.  The
	goal of this project is thus to provide a generic exporter for
	the entire sysctl tree.  Not only does this prevent unnecessary
	bloat and indirection, it may also make the life of a kernel
	developer a lot easier.  One can easily use Prometheus to graph
	the occurrence of an event over time by (temporarily) adding a
	counter to the kernel.</p>

      <p>An initial version of the sysctl exporter has been integrated
	into the &os; base system in December.  It can be run through
	<tt>inetd</tt> by uncommenting the example provided in
	<tt>inetd.conf</tt>.  Unfortunately, this exporter cannot be
	merged back to &os; 10.x/11.x, as it depends on KBI-breaking
	changes to <tt>sysctl(9)</tt>.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>Are you using Prometheus or are you interested in using
	it?  Be sure to give both Prometheus and this <tt>sysctl</tt>
	exporter a try!</task>

      <task>It would be nice if we created a set of useful alerting
	rules and placed those in /usr/share/examples.  For example, how
	can one use this exporter to monitor the state of GEOM-based
	RAID arrays?  Is such information even exported through
	<tt>sysctl</tt>?</task>

      <task>Prometheus uses a pretty nifty format for exporting
	histograms.  Histograms are useful for expressing the amount of
	time taken to complete certain events (for example, disk
	operations).  Would it be possible to add histograms as native
	datatypes to sysctl?  If so, is there any chance they can be
	implemented without picking up any kernel locks?</task>

      <p>Libarchive is a BSD-licensed archive and compression library
	originally developed as part of &os;.  It supports a wide
	variety of input and output formats and also includes three
	command-line tools: <tt>bsdcat</tt>, <tt>bsdcpio</tt> and
	<tt>bsdtar</tt>. The &os; <tt>tar</tt> and <tt>cpio</tt>
	utilities are taken directly from Libarchive, and many other
	important utilities like <tt>ar</tt>, <tt>unzip</tt>, and the
	<tt>pkg</tt> package manager make use of <tt>libarchive</tt>'s
	functions.</p>

      <p>Libarchive development in 2016 has been focusing on bug fixes
	and code cleanup, including fixing several critical security
	issues.  Automated testing with Travis CI and Jenkins has been
	introduced and <tt>libarchive</tt> has been added to the Google
	OSS-Fuzz project.  Fuzzing helped detect several hidden problems
	like buffer overflows and memory leaks.</p>

      <p>Over the last few months, NFSv4 ACL support for the pax and
	restricted pax (the default for <tt>bsdtar</tt>) formats has
	been completed and merged to &os;-CURRENT.  NFSv4 ACL entries
	can now be stored to and restored from tar archives.</p>

      <task>As every commit to libarchive may influence the build
	process of &os; ports, the ability to trigger a (semi-)automated

      <p>OpenBSM is a BSD-licensed implementation of Sun's Basic
	Security Module (BSM) API and file format.  It is the user-space
	side of the CAPP Audit implementations in &os; and Mac OS X.
	Additionally, the audit trail processing tools are expected to
	work on Linux.</p>

      <p>This quarter saw increased development activity, fueled by
	the CADETS project, resulting in the release of OpenBSM 1.2
	alpha 5.  Among this release's changes are the ability to
	specify the kernel's maximum audit queue length, sandboxing
	support for <tt>auditreduce(1)</tt> and <tt>praudit(1)</tt> on
	&os; and other systems that support Capsicum, as well as the
	addition of event identifiers for more &os; system calls.  The
	complete list of changes is documented in the <a
	href="https://github.com/openbsm/openbsm/blob/master/NEWS">NEWS</a>
	file on GitHub.  The new release will be merged into &os; HEAD
