    <body>
      <p>This report covers work since the last &os;/EC2 status report
	(2015Q1).</p>

      <p>&os;/EC2 is now part of the regular &os; release build,
	with snapshots and releases being automatically uploaded and
	copied to all available regions.  Due to legal restrictions
	this does not currently include the GovCloud or China
	(Beijing) regions; anyone wishing to use &os; in those regions
	is encouraged to contact the author.</p>

      <p>The AWS Marketplace reports that approximately 800 users
	are running roughly 2000 &os; EC2 instances.  This does not
	count the likely significantly larger number of EC2 instances
	launched "directly" through the EC2 API and Console, but at
	least places a lower bound on usage.</p>

      <p>&os; 11.0-RELEASE shipped with support for the "enhanced
	networking" support in EC2 C3, C4, R3, I2, D2, and M4
	(excluding m4.16xlarge) instances; this provides significantly
	higher network performance than the virtual networking
	available on older EC2 instances and with older versions of
	&os;.</p>

      <p>&os; 11.0-RELEASE and later also use indirect segment disk
	I/Os, which yield ~20% higher throughput with equal or lower
	latency, and support the 128-vCPU x1.32xlarge instance
	type.</p>

      <p> &os; now supports the Amazon Simple Systems Manager service
	(&quot;run command&quot;).</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>Complete a pending reorganization of the accounts used for &os;/EC2
	releases.</task>

      <task>Support &quot;second generation enhanced networking&quot; via
	the new Elastic Network Adapter found in P2, R4, X1, and
	m4.16xlarge instances.</task>

      <task>Provide tools for improved functionality via the Simple
	Systems Manager service: Listing installed packages, checking
	for updates, adding/removing users, [your favourite sysadmin
	task goes here].</task>

      <task>Add support for EC2's IPv6 networking to the default &os;/EC2
	configuration.</task>

      <task>Continue ongoing interoperability testing between &os;'s
	NFS client and Amazon Elastic File System
	(NFS-as-a-service).</task>
