         Deficiencies in the current automounter, amd(8), are a recurring problem reported by many FreeBSD users. A new automounter is being developed to address these concerns.

         The automounter is a cleanroom implementation of functionality available in most other Unix systems, using proper kernel support implemented via an autofs filesystem. The automounter supports a standard map format, and will integrate with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service.

         The code is ready to use - it has been committed to 11-CURRENT and 10-STABLE, and will ship as part of 10.1-RELEASE.  There is ongoing work on improving performance and fixing possible bugs.
