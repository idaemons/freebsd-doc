      <p>Deficiencies in the current automounter, <tt>amd(8)</tt>, are a
	recurring problem reported by many &os; users.  A new
	automounter is being developed to address these concerns.</p>

      <p>The automounter is a cleanroom implementation of
	functionality available in most other Unix systems, using
	proper kernel support implemented via an autofs filesystem.
	The automounter supports a standard map format, and will
	integrate with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
	(LDAP) service.</p>

      <p>The code is ready to use - it has been committed to 11-CURRENT
	and 10-STABLE, and will ship as part of 10.1-RELEASE.  There
	is ongoing work on improving performance and fixing possible
	bugs.</p>

      <p>
	Building on the new in-kernel iSCSI target and initiator stack
	released in &os; 10.0, Chelsio Communications has begun
	developing an offload interface to take advantage of the
	hardware offload capabilities of Chelsio T4 and T5 10 and 40
	gigabit Ethernet adapters.</p>

      <p>The code implements hardware PDU offload for both target and
	initiator.  The iSCSI stack has been modified to provide
	hardware-independent offload API, allowing offload drivers to
	be loaded as kernel modules, and to provide mechanisms for the
	system administrator to configure this feature.  The project
	is entering a testing phase.  The code will be released under
	the BSD license and is expected to be completed later in the
	year and ship in &os; 10.2-RELEASE.</p>

    <body>
      <p>ZFS is one of the premier features of &os; and the quality
	of the documentation should match that of other important
	features.  Much of the original documentation from Sun and
	Oracle has disappeared, moved, or is about the proprietary
	version of ZFS.  The OpenZFS project does not provide much
	documentation and instead provides users with a few links,
	including the &os; Handbook.  New users have many questions
	about ZFS and yet there exists a great deal more bad advice
	about ZFS than proper documentation.</p>

      <p>After over a year of work, a new ZFS chapter has been added
	to the &os; Handbook.  Over 20,000 words describing the
	basics of creating, managing and maintaining a ZFS pool, as
	well as using some of the advanced features like compression,
	deduplication, and delegation.  The chapter also contains a
	glossary of terms, explaining a number of the concepts unique
	to ZFS.  The chapter also includes documentation of some of
	the many sysctl variables that can be used to tune ZFS.</p>

      <p>The remaining work is the FAQ section.  To help users address
	the most common questions or problems they might face with
	ZFS.  It would be useful to hear experiences, questions,
	misconceptions, gotchas, stumbling blocks and suggestions for
	the FAQ section from other users.  Also, a use cases section
	that highlights some of the cases where ZFS provides
	advantages over traditional file systems.</p>

    <body>
      <p>In May, &a.rodrigc; led a working group <em>Continuous
	  Integration and Testing with Jenkins for &os;</em> at the
	&os; Devsummit in Ottawa.  &a.rodrigc; also gave a Jenkins
	presentation at BSDCan.</p>

      <p>At BSDCan, &a.rodrigc; had some discussions with &a.jmmv;
	about how to better integrate &os; testing efforts with
	Jenkins and kyua.  As a result of this discussion, &a.jmmv;
	enhanced the <tt>kyua</tt> testing framework with a
	<tt>kyua report-junit</tt> command.  This command takes kyua
	test results and outputs a test report in JUnit XML format.
	Jenkins can directly import JUnit XML test results and display
	them nicely.</p>

      <p>In June, &a.rodrigc; was interviewed for episode 44 of BSD
	Now.  The interview covered Jenkins and Continuous Integration
	in the &os; project.</p>

      <p>In July, &a.rodrigc; gave a presentation to the Bay Area &os;
	Users Group (BAFUG), <em>Libvirt and bhyve</em>, based on
	experience he had with those technologies when used with
	Jenkins.</p>

      <p>&a.lwhsu; set up a Jenkins job to run the LLVM scan-build
	tool to perform static analysis of the &os; code, and make the
	results availalble at <tt>scan.freebsd.org</tt>.</p>

      <p>&a.swills; modified the Jenkins job which builds
	<tt>pkg(8)</tt> to use the <tt>kyua report-junit</tt> command
	to integrate <tt>pkg(8)</tt> test results in Jenkins.</p>

      <p>Anthony Williams reported that the version of the Java
	Native Access (JNA) library bundled with Jenkins has problems
	on &os;.  This causes problems with Jenkins using libpam and
	other plugins which use JNA.  Craig filed JENKINS-24521
	against Jenkins.  Craig submitted patches to Jenkins to update
	Jenkins to use JNA 4.1.0, which has fixes for &os;.  Github
	pull request 1410 was accepted into Jenkins, while pull
	request 1387 is pending.</p>

      <p>&a.rodrigc; worked on automatically running the tests in the
	&os; <tt>/usr/tests</tt> directory under Jenkins using the
	<tt>kyua</tt> test framework.  &a.rodrigc; provided feedback
	to &a.jmmv; about <tt>kyua</tt> and &a.jmmv; incorporated some
	of the feedback as bugfixes and feature enhancements to
	<tt>kyua</tt>.  &a.rodrigc; committed some fixes to &os; to
	eliminate some test failures.  One of the tests still results
	in a crash in byacc.  This is being tracked in PR 193499.
	Thomas E. Dickey (byacc maintainer) submitted a patch to fix
	the problem, and this has been committed to &os;.</p>

      <p>&a.rodrigc; analyzed the cause of some startup errors in
	Jenkins when opening a multicast socket.  He had some
	discussion with &a.bms; captured in PR 193246.  The Java JDK
	depends on functionality in Solaris where it is possible to
	open an IPv4 multicast socket, but with an IPv4 multicast
	address mapped to an IPv6 address.  On Linux, there are
	modifications to the JDK itself to work around this.  &a.bms;
	said that the work to make the &os; IPv6 stack behave like
	Solaris would require some work.</p>

      <p>&a.rodrigc; started writing a Kyua Quickstart Guide.  This
	guide is meant to help new kyua users who want to write tests
	and run them under kyua.  &a.rodrigc; is seeking feedback to
	help improve this guide.</p>

      <p>The LLVM address sanitizer (Asan) has been ported to &os;.
	The mainline version of LLVM is known to pass all unit and lit
	Asan tests without unexpected failures on &os; 10.0.</p>

      <p>A buildbot running sanitizers tests under &os; stable/10
	has been established.  See the Links section.</p>

      <p>In order to make it possible to run programs with sanitizers
	checks enabled on &os; a new kernel state named
	<tt>kern.proc_vmmap_skip_resident_count</tt> has been added.
	See the Links section.</p>

      <p>Note that running Asan tests on stable/10 requires that state

      <p>The newest graphics stack (that is, ports behind the
	WITH_NEW_XORG knob) was enabled on all architectures.  The
	only regression is for users of Intel GPUs and &os; 8.X or
	9.0.  Those releases lack the required kernel driver and
	therefore <tt>xf86-video-intel</tt> will not work (the last
	UMS-aware version does not work with xserver 1.12).  Users can
	still use <tt>xf86-video-vesa</tt> if they cannot or do not
	want to update their &os; workstation.  Owners of Radeon GPUs
	can use <tt>xf86-video-ati-ums</tt> 6.14.6 with
	<tt>xserver</tt> 1.12 if the KMS driver is not available (that
	is, before &os; 9.3).</p>

      <p>The old graphics stack will be removed with the next update
	to these ports.  See the announcement in the Links
	section.</p>

      <p>Hardware context support was added to the i915 driver in both
	HEAD and 10.1-RELEASE. This will allow us to update libglapi,
	libGL, dri, libEGL and libglesv2 ports to a newer version of
	Mesa.  The latest version is already available from our
	development ports tree (see the links section).</p>

      <p>Cairo was updated to 1.12.  This will allow the &os; GNOME
	team to upgrade pango and Gtk+ 3.  Unfortunately, the update
	also revealed that xf86-video-intel 2.7.1 was in a much worse
	state than previously assumed.</p>

      <p>We will attend XDC 2014 (X.Org Developer's Conference) from
	October 8th through 10th in Bordeaux, France.  The goal is to
	reconnect with graphics stack developers, mostly working with
	Linux these days.  We will give a presentation on the current
	state of this stack on &os;.  See the XDC website in the Links
	section for the program and live streaming.</p>

    <body>
      <p>ZFSguru is a multifunctional server appliance with a strong
	emphasis on storage.  ZFSguru began as simple web-interface
	frontend to ZFS, but has since grown into a &os; derivative
	with its own infrastructure.  The scope of the project has
	also grown with the inclusion of add-on packages that add
	functionality beyond the traditional NAS functionality found
	in similar product like FreeNAS and NAS4Free.  ZFSguru aims to
	be a true multifunctional server appliance that is extremely
	easy to set up and can unite both novice and more experienced
	users in a single user interface.  The modular nature of the
	project combats the danger of bloat, whilst still allowing
	extended functionality to be easily deployed.</p>

      <p>The development work in Q3 focused heavily on the new build
	infrastructure.  This allows the ZFSguru project to release
	new system images together with addon services at much higher
	frequency and with much less manual intervention.  This should
	free up a lot of development time to be spent on the core of
	the project: the web-interface.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, a new website and forum is being worked at,
	replacing the old-fashioned website that offers only limited
	functionality.  The new website will be linked to the server
	database, providing real-time updates about the project.</p>

      <p>In addition, a new platform for collaborated development is
	in the works.  A service addon has been created for the GitLab
	project, which is a drop-in replacement of the popular GitHub
	website.  The choice was made to host our own solution and not
	rely on GitHub itself.  In retrospect this appears to have
	been a good decision.  The recent development where GitHub
	removed projects after DCMA-takedowns being sent is
	incompatible with the philosophy of free-flow-of-information,
	of which the ZFSguru project is a strong proponent.  By
	hosting our own solution, we have avoided any dependency on
	third party projects.</p>

      <p>The next task will be to introduce a new remote database
	structure, dubbed GuruDB.  This will speed up the
	web-interface as well as introduce Service Bulletins which
	address important notifications to our users, as well as
	announce new releases.</p>

      <p>After GuruDB, the Migration Manager is one of the last
	remaining features still missing in the web-interface.  This
	functionality provides an easy way to upgrade the current
	system by performing a new clean installation, but migrate all
	relevant configuration to the new installation.  It also
	allows users to 'backup' all system configuration in a single
	file to be stored on a different machine should things go
	awry.</p>

      <p>A longer version of the 2014 development progress of the
	ZFSguru project and information specific to the newly-released
	10.1-002 system image can be found in the Links section.</p>

      <p>The &os; Python team continued to improve the overall
	experience with Python-based software on &os;.</p>

      <p>During the last quarter, the <tt>bsd.python.mk</tt> bits of
	the ports infrastructure were converted to the more modern
	<tt>USES</tt> format.  Several options, such as support for
	<tt>easy_install</tt>, were deprecated or removed to make the
	infrastructure easier to maintain and less complex for
	maintainers.</p>

      <p>The Python ports were refactored and simplified to improve
	maintenance and to get rid of long-standing issues due to the
	previously complex and error-prone build process.</p>

      <p>The Python 2 branch was updated to Python 2.7.8 and
	<tt>setuptools</tt> to 5.5.1.</p>

      <p>With the availability of pkg 1.3, installing Python packages
	and modules for different Python versions is now supported in
	the package management infrastructure.  This allows us to
	remove the previously required port duplicates for Python 2
	and Python 3.</p>
