      <p>Progress on moving PC-BSD &amp; TrueOS to a "rolling release"
	is happening quickly.  We have implemented our own package
	repository, fully based on <tt>pkg(8)</tt>, which is updated twice
	monthly, and are now hosting dedicated
	<tt>freebsd-update(8)</tt> systems.  In addition to the
	<tt>9.1-RELEASE</tt> ISO images, we have begun to create a
	<tt>9-STABLE</tt> branch as well, using
	<tt>freebsd-update(8)</tt> to push out the latest world and
	kernel binaries on a monthly basis.</p>

      <p>We are currently working on an implementation of ZFS Boot
	Environments for desktops and servers.  These users to install
	updates or experimental versions in separate ZFS clones and
	select the one to run at boot time, providing an easy way of
	testing upgrades before deployment.</p>

      <p>Recently the &os; wireless networking stack has received
	updates in the following areas:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Improved transmit locking in <tt>net80211(4)</tt> to
	  eliminate a whole class of subtle race conditions leading to
	  out-of-order packets being handed to the driver.</li>

	<li>Spectral scan (FFT) information is now available for the
	  AR9280, AR9285, AR9287 series NICs.</li>

	<li>Added support for AR93xx, AR94xx, AR95xx NICs &mdash;
	  <tt>hostap</tt>, <tt>adhoc</tt> and <tt>station</tt> modes
	  have been tested, including 3x3 stream support for the those
	  NICs where appropriate.</li>

	<li>Implemented ps-poll handling in <tt>hostap</tt> mode.  This
	  was required for correct behaviour with stations that implement
	  aggressive power save.</li>

	<li>Added AR933x SoC support &mdash; including all on-board
	  peripherals &mdash; the <tt>8devices.com</tt> Carambola-2
	  board is now fully supported and will run &os; from NOR
	  flash.</li>

      <p>A VT-d driver was developed that implements the
	<tt>busdma(9)</tt> interface using the DMA Remap units (DMARs)
	found in current Intel chipsets.  The driver provides
	reliability and security improvements for the system by
	facilitating restricted access to main memory from busmastering
	devices.</p>

      <p>It also eliminates bounce buffering (copying) by allocating
	remapped regions that satisfy a device's access limitations.</p>

      <p>With additional work to define a suitable interface the VT-d
	driver will also provide PCI pass-through functionality for
	hypervisors.</p>

      <p>This project aims to improve scalability of the virtual memory
	subsystem.  Based on a prototype change from Jeff Roberson,
	per-domain page queues and per-domain pagedaemon working threads
	have been implemented to enable this.  At the moment, the
	domains coincide with the NUMA proximity domains, but this is
	not neccessary and could be improved with further separation to
	allow more parallelism in the pagedaemon.</p>

      <p>The patch is relatively simple, with the most delicate parts
	being the page laundry and OOM logic, which requires coordination
	between all pagedaemon threads to prevent false triggering.</p>

      <p>Testing on diverse workloads and on real multi-socket machines
	is required.</p>

      <p>The KDE/&os; Team have continued to improve the experience of
	KDE software and Qt under &os;.  During this quarter, the team
	has kept most of the KDE and Qt ports up-to-date, working on the
	following releases:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>KDE SC: 4.10.2, 4.10.3, 4.10.4</li>
	<li>Qt: 5.0.2 (area51)</li>
	<li>PyQt: 4.10.2; QScintilla 2.7.2; SIP: 4.14.7</li>
	<li>KDevelop: 4.5.1</li>
	<li>Calligra: 2.6.2</li>
	<li>CMake: 2.8.11.1</li>
	<li>Digikam (and KIPI-plugins): 3.1.0, 3.2.0 </li>
	<li>KDE Telepathy: 0.6.0, 0.6.1</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As a result &mdash; according to <a
	  href="http://portscout.freebsd.org/kde@freebsd.org.html">PortScout</a>
	&mdash; <tt>kde@</tt> has 473 ports (up from 431), of which
	98.73% are up-to-date (up from 93.5%).  iXsystems Inc.
	continues to provided a machine for the team to build packages
	and to test updates.  iXsystems Inc. has been providing the
	KDE/&os; Team with support for quite a long time and we are very
	grateful for that.  This quarter, we would also like to thank
	Steve Wills (<tt>swills@</tt>) for providing access to another
	machine so that we can do our work even faster.</p>

      <p>While a great deal of the team's efforts are focused towards
	packaging released code, we also take a proactive stand in
	making sure future versions of the software we port is also
	going to work well on &os;.  This involves being in close
	contact with upstream, raising awareness of &os; as an active
	project and also sending actual patches that most of the time
	benefit many other operating systems besides &os; itself.  In
	this regard, we have been dedicating a lot of time making sure
	both <tt>clang</tt> and <tt>libc++</tt> are fully supported in
	KDE and Qt.  Not only has this resulted in many patches being
	sent to these projects, but the exposure to these large code
	bases have been beneficial to the Clang-on-&os; project as well.
	Dimitry Andric (<tt>dim@</tt>) has been of great help as a point
	of contact for all the issues we have faced.</p>

      <p>As usual, the team is always looking for more testers and
	porters so please contact us and visit our home page.  It would
	be especially useful to have more helping hands on tasks such as
	getting rid of the dependency on the defunct HAL project and
	providing integration with KDE's Bluedevil Bluetooth

      <p>The Documentation Project has been using old versions of markup
	standards until recently when we switched to a real XML
	toolchain and DocBook 4.5.  However, we still depend on obsolete
	technologies &mdash; DSSSL and Jade.  Besides, DocBook 5.0
	provides cleaner markup and some nice new features.</p>

      <p>The objective of this project is to upgrade the documentation
	set to DocBook 5.0 and to find a way to properly render our
	sources without using DSSSL, since the DSSSL stylesheets are
	discontinued and cannot render DocBook 5.0.  The documentation
	sources have already been successfully transformed to DocBook
	5.0 and updates to the rendering process are under
	development.  The common opinion among &os; developers is that
	Java is a heavy dependency that should be avoided.  This has
	suggested the transformation of DocBook sources to TeX and use
	TeX as a rendering backend.  There are two ways to do this; the
	sources can be transformed either directly or through the XSL FO
	output generated by the stylesheets provided for the DocBook Project.
	The latter approach has been chosen as a preferred
	way since it better fits the existing documentation
	infrastructure and provides easier customization.</p>

      <p>Due to non-&os;-related activities from April to end of June,
	the project progressed slowly:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Some important problems in TTM were fixed and several others
	  are being worked out.  Applications affected by these bugs are
	  non-linear video editing software (which do not use Xv to
	  preview the video) or "screen" of VirtualBox, for
	  instance.</li>

	<li>Regarding the locking issue with OpenGL, no work has been
	  done yet.  <tt>glxgears</tt> works but some modern desktop
	  environments or WebGL demos hang.  Once TTM bugs described
	  above are fixed, this is the next target.</li>

	<li>Patches to Mesa to make it build out-of-the-box were
	  submitted upstream.  As of writing, some were committed but
	  not all of them.  Additionally, as result of a joint work with
	  Jonathan Gray (of OpenBSD), Mesa should work on &os;, OpenBSD,
	  and hopefully on other BSD flavors without additional
	  patches.</li>
      </ul>

	<p>Several users tested the driver.  Andriy Gapon, Jonathan

      <p>As of the end of June, &os;'s ZFS implementation now includes
	TRIM support in <tt>head</tt>, <tt>stable/9</tt>, and
	<tt>stable/8</tt> branches.  This allows ZFS to help maintain
	high performance on flash-based devices such as SSD's even under
	high-load conditions.</p>

      <p>When creating new pools and adding new devices to existing
	pools it first performs a full-device level TRIM to help ensure
	optimum starting performance.  This behaviour can be overridden
	by setting the <tt>vfs.zfs.vdev.trim_on_init</tt> sysctl
	variable to <tt>0</tt> if for example the disks are new or have
	already been secure erased, which can also now be done using
	<tt>camcontrol(8)</tt> security actions.</p>

      <p>In order to support TRIM, the kernel requires the underlying
	device driver supports <tt>BIO_DELETE</tt>.  This is currently
	mapped through to hardware methods such as ATA TRIM and SCSI
	UNMAP, which are commonly supported by SSDs via CAM.</p>

      <p>In order to increase the supported hardware base, CAM's SCSI
	layer was also enhanced to allow ATA TRIM via SATL ATA
	Passthrough to be used in addition to the existing UNMAP and WS
	methods.  This allows SATA disks attached to SCSI controllers
	with CAM based drivers such as <tt>mps(4)</tt> and
	<tt>mpt(4)</tt> to provide delete support.</p>

      <p>Stats for ZFS TRIM can be monitored by looking at the sysctl
	variables under <tt>kstat.zfs.misc.zio_trim</tt> in addition to
	live GEOM delete stats via the <tt>gstat -d</tt> command.</p>

      <p>The ARM architecture is more and more prevalent, not only in
	the mobile and embedded space.  Among the more interesting
	industry trends emerging in the recent months, there has been
	the concept of "ARM server".  Some top-tier companies, e.g.
	Dell and HP, have already started to develop such systems.</p>

      <p>Key to success of &os; in these new areas is dealing with the
	sophisticated features of the platform, for example adding
	support for superpages.</p>

      <p>The objective of this project is to enable &os;/arm to utilize
	superpages which would allow efficient use of TLB translations
	(by enlarging TLB coverage), leading to improved performance in
	many applications and scalability.  This is intended to work on
	ARMv7-based processors, however compatibility with ARMv6 will be
	preserved.</p>

      <p>LLDB is the the debugger project in the LLVM family.  It
	supports the Mac OS X, Linux, and &os; platforms, but the latter
	has recently suffered under a lack of maintenance.</p>

      <p>After cleaning bit rot in LLDB's &os; support, it again builds
	and can be used for basic debugging of single-threaded
	applications.  The test suite also runs to completion, although
	it experiences a large number of failures.</p>

      <p>Ed Maste has been granted an LLDB commit bit, and is now
	committing ongoing bug fixes and development directly to the
	upstream repository.  There is a significant amount of work
	still to be done, with one goal being the incorporation of
	<tt>lldb</tt> into the base system.</p>

      <p>This project is sponsored by DARPA/AFRL in collaboration with
	SRI International and the University of Cambridge.</p>

      <p>The native kernel iSCSI target and initiator project progressed
	well over the April to June period.  The primary focus was to
	introduce support for iSER (iSCSI over RDMA) in both the
	initiator and the target.  Prerequisite for this was merging
	some common parts together and implementing a workaround for the
	lack of iSER support in userspace.  Apart from that, there were
	a myriad of smaller improvements.  Such as creating more
	user-friendly administration utilities, for example
	<tt>iscsictl(8)</tt> which displays SCSI device nodes for each
	iSCSI session.  This frees the user from getting the same
	information through <tt>camcontrol(8)</tt>.  But there are
	improvements in logging and manual pages as well.</p>

      <p>Once the iSER support becomes stable, the work will focus on
	performance optimizations.  The plan is to commit both the new
	initiator and target in August to allow shipping them in 10.0.
	The project will continue with implementing support for software
	iWARP stack (useful mostly for testing and development), SCSI
	passthrough and various other improvements.</p>

	<li>In response to another comment that our message rejection

      <p>Capsicum (lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework) is
	being actively worked on.  In the last few months the following
	tasks have been completed:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Committed Capsicum overhaul to &os; <tt>head</tt> (r247602).
	  This allows to use capability rights in more places, simplifies
	  kernel code and implements ability to limit <tt>ioctl(2)</tt>
	  and <tt>fcntl(2)</tt> system calls.</li>

	<li><tt>hastd(8)</tt> is now using Capsicum for sandboxing, as
	  whitelisting ioctls is possible (r248297).</li>

	<li><tt>auditdistd(8)</tt> is now using Capsicum for sandboxing,
	  as it is now possible to setup append-only restriction on file
	  descriptor (available in Perforce).</li>

	<li>Implemented <tt>connectat(2)</tt> and <tt>bindat(2)</tt>
	  system calls for UNIX domain sockets that are allowed in
	  capability mode (r247667).</li>

	<li>Implemented <tt>chflagsat(2)</tt> system call
	  (r248599).</li>

	<li>Revised the Casper daemon for application capabilities.</li>

	<li>Implemented <tt>libcapsicum</tt> for application
	  capabilities.</li>

	<li>Implemented various Casper services to be able to use more
	  functionality within a sandbox: <tt>system.dns</tt>,
	  <tt>system.pwd</tt>, <tt>system.grp</tt>,
	  <tt>system.random</tt>, <tt>system.filesystem</tt>,
	  <tt>system.socket</tt>, <tt>system.sysctl</tt>.</li>

	<li>Implemented Capsicum sandboxing for <tt>kdump(1)</tt> (from
	  r251073 to r251167).  The version in Perforce also supports
	  sandboxing for the <tt>-r</tt> flag, using Casper
	  services.</li>

	<li>Implemented Capsicum sandboxing for <tt>dhclient(8)</tt>
	  (from r252612 to r252697).</li>

	<li>Implemented Capsicum sandboxing for <tt>tcpdump(8)</tt>
	  (available in Perforce).</li>

	<li>Implemented Capsicum sandboxing for <tt>libmagic(3)</tt>
	  (available in Perforce).</li>

	<li>Implemented the <tt>libnv</tt> library for name/value pairs
	  handling in the hope of wider adaptation across &os;.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For Capsicum-based sandboxing in the &os; base system, the
	commits referenced above and the provided code aim to serve as
	examples.  We would like to see more &os; tools to be sandboxed
	&mdash; every tool that can parse data from untrusted sources,
	for example.</p>
