      <p>Two new documentation committers were added to the team in
	the second quarter of 2015.</p>

      <p>Mathieu Arnold is a member of the &os; Ports Management Team.
	Over the past year, he has worked on many large and complex
	updates to keep the Porter's Handbook current, and
	continues to update this important document.</p>

      <p>Anne Dickison is Marketing Director for the &os; Foundation.
	She will focus on updating and improving the &os; main web
	site.</p>

      <p>We welcome both new committers and look forward to their
	additional contributions!</p>

    <body>
      <p>During the Developer Summit held in the two days before
	BSDCan, a documentation working group meeting was held.  We
	discussed some of the biggest opportunities available to the
	documentation team.</p>

      <p>Modernizing our translation system was, again, a major topic.
	Making it easier for translators to do their work is vitally
	important.  Translations make &os; much more accessible for
	non-English speakers, and those people and the translators
	themselves often become valuable technical contributors in
	other areas.  Progress was made in this area, and we hope to
	have more news soon.</p>

      <p>Methods of making it easier for people to contribute to
	documentation was another major topic.  At present, we use
	DocBook XML for articles and books, and mdoc(7) for man pages.
	These markup languages are not very welcoming for new users.
	There are simpler documentation markup languages like RST,
	Markdown, and AsciiDoc that take less time to learn and use.
	In fact, these markup systems are all similar to each other.
	These systems tend to be more oriented towards visual
	appearance rather than the semantic markup of our present
	systems, there might be ways to work around that.</p>

      <p>Following the theme of making contributing easier, we also
	discussed giving easier access so users can make additions to
	the &os; Wiki.  Like any other useful web resource, it was
	horribly abused by spammers and access was limited to prevent
	that abuse.  It is tricky to allow submissions yet keep the
	quality of submitted information usefully high.</p>

      <p>Due to the markup systems used, it is difficult to review
	documents for the quality of their information.  Annotator is
	a Javascript system that allows adding notes to an existing
	web page.  This would allow us to hold content-only reviews of
	documentation web pages.  Reviewers would not see markup, so
	they could concentrate only on whether the information was
	accurate and complete.  To use this as desired, we need some
	help with ports and testing.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>
	<p>Complete a port for the backend storage component of
	  Annotator.  Preferably this would be the lowest overhead and
	  most open-licensed version available.  Assistance from those
	  familiar with Python and Javascript web development is
	  welcome.</p>

      <p><tt>pkgsrc</tt> is a fork of &os; ports from the NetBSD
	project with a focus on portability and multi platform
	support.  At present, pkgsrc supports building packages on 23
	different platforms from a single tree, including &os;</p>

      <p>While <tt>pkgsrc</tt> is not a replacement for ports in most
	use cases, it holds a unique position in mixed platform
	environments where software ideally needs to be the same
	version across the board and should built in a consistent
	manner, saving the user from having to resort to manually
	building programs or re-implementing a mechanism to do so.</p>

      <p>With the recent
	<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-users/2015/07/06/msg021778.html">2015Q2 release</a>
	earlier this month, it is now possible to generate over 14000
	packages on FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE (up from 12800 last
	quarter).</p>

      <p>Work is in progress to add
	<a href="https://vimeo.com/132766052">pkgng support to pkgsrc.</a></p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>
	<p>Improve platform support to skip libusb on &os; where
	libusb is bundled in base.  This is causing the biggest
	breakage at the moment.</p>
      </task>

      <task>
	<p>Expand the effort to -STABLE and -CURRENT branches and, if
	  possible, architectures other than AMD64.  Shell access
	  welcome (without privilege is sufficient).</p>
