    <title>&os; Forum Software Migration</title>

      <p>With funding from the &os; Foundation, the &os; forums
	were migrated to XenForo software.  The new software is far more
	capable and easy to use.  While the entire forum team
	contributed, &a.danger; did a particularly excellent job
	importing existing users and messages and bringing back the
	often-requested "Thanks" feature.  The upgrade was completed in
	time to be ready for the influx of new users from the release of
	&os; 10.1, and we have already seen an increase in usage.</p>

      <p>Developers with an @FreeBSD.org address can contact forum
	administrators to obtain the highly-desired "@"	suffix on their
	forum user name along with a Developer flag.</p>

      <p>We want to thank the Foundation for making this possible, and
	the users for their patience and continued presence on the
	forums!</p>
