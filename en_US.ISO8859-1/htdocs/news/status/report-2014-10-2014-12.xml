      <p>With funding from the &os; Foundation, the &os; forums
	were migrated to XenForo software.  The new software is far more
	capable and easy to use.  While the entire forum team
	contributed, &a.danger; did a particularly excellent job
	importing existing users and messages and bringing back the
	often-requested "Thanks" feature.  The upgrade was completed in
	time to be ready for the influx of new users from the release of
	&os; 10.1, and we have already seen an increase in usage.</p>

      <p>Developers with an @FreeBSD.org address can contact forum
	administrators to obtain the highly-desired "@"	suffix on their
	forum user name along with a Developer flag.</p>

      <p>We want to thank the Foundation for making this possible, and

      <p>There were several improvements made to the FreeBSD process
	management last quarter.</p>

      <p>Reaper. The facility to allow a process to reliably track the
	running and exiting state of the whole subtree of the processes,
	was added.  It is intended to improve tools like timeout(1) or
	poudriere, by making it impossible for the runaway granchild to
	escape the controlling process.  Feature was designed based on
	similar facility in the DragonFlyBSD and Linux, with some
	references to the Solaris contracts.  Committed to HEAD in
	r275800.</p>

      <p>Total stop.  Right now, the FreeBSD suspension code does not
	ensures that the system, both from software and from hardware
	view, is in the steady and consistent state.  One aspect is the
	usermode process activity which is not stopped, continuing to
	making requests to the hardware.  It is not realistic to expect
	drivers to be able to correctly handle the calls after
	SUSPEND_CHILD.</p>

      <p>Together with Peter Holm, we developed a facility to stop
	usermode threads at the safe points, where they are known to not
	own and to not wait for kernel resources, in particular, not
	waiting for device requests finishing.  It is based on the
	existing single-threading code, but extending it to allow external
	thread to put some process into stopped state.  Also, a facility
	to sync filesystems before suspend was added, to ensure that
	consistent metadata and as much as possilbe of the cached user
	data are on stable storage, to minimize damage of failed
	resume.</p>

      <p>The code stressed some parts of the system and lead to
	discovery of the unusual numbers of bugs in the different parts of
	the system, including process management, buffer cache and syscall
	handlers.  The bugs were fixed, fixes and the features commmitted
	by a series culminating in r275745.</p>

      <p>Process spinlock changes. During the work described above, it
	was noted that process spinlock duties are significantly
	overloaded (the same is true for the process lock).  The spinlock
	was split into per-feature lock, see r275121.  Also, as result, it
	was possible to eliminate recursion on it, r275372.</p>

      <p>The package development team has released <tt>pkg(8)</tt> 1.4.
	This release fixes lots of bugs and adds some new features:
	<ul>
	  <li>Stricter checking of the path passed via the plist</li>
	  <li>Change in the ABI to be closer to MACHINE_ARCH</li>
	  <li>Add three-way merge functionnality</li>
	  <li>Add conservative upgrade support for multi repository configurations</li>
	  <li>Multirepository priority</li>
	</ul>
      </p>

      <p>An important part of the development direction for the 1.4
	release has been done on stabilizing the existing features, and
	improving the <tt>pkg(8)</tt> experience on small/embedded
	machines (reduce memory usage, speed up operations).</p>

      <p><tt>pkg(8)</tt> is not only the &os; Package Manager, but the
	Package Manager for DragonflyBSD.  Additionally support has been
	added to build <tt>pkg(8)</tt> on OS X and Linux.  This work
	will allow other Operating Systems the option of adopting
	<tt>pkg(8)</tt> to manage their packages and bring new
	developers into the project.</p>

      <p>The main goal of the external toolchain project is to be able
	to build world and kernel with non default toolchain.  It can be
	helpful to:
	<ul>
	  <li>Prepare a migration to a newer version of the components like compilers, binutils, and elftoolchain.</li>
	  <li>Port &os; to newer architecture</li>
	  <li>Upgrade from a &os; that ships with GCC 4.2 to a version that ship with clang 3.5+ (which need a more modern toolchain than GCC 4.2 to bootstrap.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>

      <p>The initial support for external toolchain only supported
	clang.  It has been extended to support recent GCC (4.9.1 has
	been tested) and recent binutils (2.24 and 2.25).</p>

      <p>A large number of fixes have been committed to HEAD to support
	incompatible behaviour changes between <tt>ld(1)</tt> from
	binutils 2.17.50 (the version in base) and binutils 2.24+.</p>

      <p>A large number of warnings have been deactivated when building
	the kernel to make sure it is possible to build the kernel with
	recent GCC (first 4.6 and then 4.9.1)</p>

      <p>The build system has been changed to build libc++ as a C++
	stack when a recent enough GCC (4.6+) is used to build world.
	</p>

      <p>To simplify using an external toolchain, the following
	pre-seeded configurations have been added to the ports tree:
	<ul>
	  <li>amd64-xtoolchain-gcc</li>
	  <li>powerpc64-xtoolchain-gcc</li>
	  <li>sparc64-xtoolchain-gcc</li>
	</ul>
      </p>

      <p>Those packages will depend on special version of GCC
	(minimalistic cross-built ready GCC) and on binutils.  To use
	them run: <tt>make CROSS_TOOLCHAIN=powerpc64-gcc TARGET=powerpc
	TARGET_ARCH=powerpc64</tt></p>

      <p>As a result of this effort, it has been possible to
	successfully build and run a kernel and world built with GCC
	4.9.1 and binutils 2.24 on sparc64, amd64 (with minor tweaks for
	amd64), powerpc and powerpc64.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD GNOME Team maintains the GNOME, MATE and CINNAMON desktop
	environments and graphical user interfaces for FreeBSD. GNOME 3 is part
	of the GNU Project. MATE is a fork of the GNOME 2 desktop. CINNAMON
	is desktop environment using GNOME 3 technologies but with a GNOME 2
	look and feel.</p>

      <p>This quarter was exciting time for the GNOME Team. We imported
	GNOME 3.14.0 and CINNAMON 2.2.16 into the ports tree. At the same
	time we removed the old GNOME 2.32 desktop. And two weeks later
	we updated GNOME to 3.14.2 and CINNAMON to 2.4.2 which was collected
	while the preparation for the initial GNOME 3.14.0 import was
	underway.</p>

      <p>We moved our development repo to GitHub. The link is in the links
	section. The <tt>master</tt> branch is vanilla, and we have
	<tt>theme branches</tt> for topic, like the porting of MATE 1.9
	(mate-1.10 branch) and GNOME 3.15 (gnome-3.16 branch). The GNOME

    <body>
      <p>The &os; Core Team constitutes the project's "Board of
	Directors", responsible for deciding the project's overall goals
	and direction as well as managing specific areas of the &os;
	project landscape.</p>

      <p>During the fourth quarter of 2014, the &os; Core team saw the
	culmination of a long-running project to rebuild the &os;
	Forums.  The chosen solution was to license XenForo; core would
	like to thank the FreeBSD Foundation for paying the licensing
	costs of this software.</p>

      <p>Much discussion ensued concerning the "New Support Model"
	following Core's meeting at EuroBSDCon in September.  It was
	recognised that trying to change the model immediately before
	10.1-RELEASE was far too late, and the change will be targeted
	at 11.0-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>In order to ensure that 10.1-RELEASE shipped with support for
	up-to-date X Windows and KDE4, core approved the switch to 'new
	Xorg' as the default in time for building the packages for that
	release.</p>

      <p>Git was officially promoted from beta to an officially
	supported version control system.  Git is available as a
	read-only resource for downstream consumers and contains an
	exported copy from SVN, the primary and only read-write
	repository.  The &os; git repositories (exported from the
	master SVN version control) will shortly be available at
	https://git.freebsd.org/, and core has been active
	in ensuring that there is a sufficient body of Git
	administrators available with access to appropriate
	documentation in order to maintain a good git service.</p>

      <p>Core mediated in disputes between a number of committers over
	some updates to system sources, and fielded complaints about
	code quality of some other work in critical areas.
	While such disagreements will occasionally occur, core is
	promoting the routine use of the phabricator service in order to
	review work before committal.  Catching problems early is in the
	project's best interests, and discussion of changes in an open
	review context should minimize confrontational demands for
	immediate back-out of changes.</p>

      <p>Core is working on a charter for a proposed new QA team, to
	encompass members of the Release Engineering and Security teams,
	as well as committers with interests in standards compliance.
	It is envisioned that the QA team will take responsibility for
	merging code from HEAD into the STABLE branches, run integration
	testing against those updates and handle merging patches and
	bug-fixes submitted to the &os; project from third parties.</p>

      <p>During this quarter, core issued two new commit bits, and also
	took two commit bits into safe-keeping.</p>

      <p>The KDE on &os; team focuses on packaging and making sure that the
	experience of KDE and Qt on &os; is as good as possible.</p>

      <p>As mentioned last quarter, Alonso Schaich (alonso@) became a

	Raphael Kubo da Costa (rakuco@) and Max Brazhnikov (makc@) maintain all
	Qt and KDE-related ports.</p>

      <p>This quarter, Qt 5.3 was finally committed to the ports tree
	after extensive work that included cleaning up and/or changing a lot of
	the Qt5 ports infrastructure to make it both easier to maintain the Qt
	ports as well as finally make it possible to build newer versions when
	older ones are already installed on the system.</p>

      <p>We have also updated KDE in our experimental area51 repository
	and committed several updates to other ports such as KDevelop and KDE

      <p>Since the last status report, many people have contributed
	help in various areas to help with with Continuous Integration
	and Testing in FreeBSD.  Some of the highlights include:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The Jenkins project mentioned on their blog how FreeBSD is using
	  Jenkins and kyua to run OS-level tests.</li>

	<li>&a.rodrigc; submitted patches to upgrade Jenkins to use JNA 4.1.0.
	  The Jenkins project accepted these patches [JENKINS-24521] in
	  the Jenkins 1.586 release.  This fixed problems with PAM
	  authentication support in Jenkins on FreeBSD [JENKINS-21507].</li>

	<li>&a.rodrigc; gave a presentation Kyua and Jenkins Testing
	  Framework for BSD at the Developer and Vendor summit on
	  November 3, 2014 in San Jose, California.  In the presentation,
	  &a.rodrigc;'s described how for every commit to the FreeBSD source
	  tree, nearly 3000 tests are run using kyua inside a bhyve virtual
	  machine.  The kyua test results are exported to JUnit XML format,
	  which is then used by Jenkins to generate web-based test reports with
	  graphs.</li>

	<li>&a.lwhsu; set up a Jenkins build named FreeBSD_Doc-igor
	  to run the Igor tool written by &a.wblock;.  Igor proofreads
	  FreeBSD documentation and reports various errors.</li>

	<li>&a.rodrigc; set up a Jenkins build named
	  FreeBSD_HEAD_sparc64 to build the FreeBSD HEAD branch for
	  the sparc64 architecture</li>

	<li>&a.ngie; imported more tests from NetBSD.  After this import,
	  there are now over 3000 tests in the /usr/tests
	  directory.</li>

	<li>Susan Stanziano from Xinuous ran kyua tests and provided
	  feedback about test errors, running the tests in a bhyve
	  VM.</li>

	<li>Andy Zhang from Microsoft ran kyua tests and provided
	  feedback about test errors running in a Hyper-V 2012R2
	  VM.</li>

	<li>&a.swills; ran the &os; tests in Google Compute Engine and provided
	  the test results.</li>

	<li>&a.rodrigc; submitted a formula to create a package for
	  kyua in the Homebrew packaging system on OS X.  The Homebrew project
	  accepted this.  Now, kyua can easily be installed on OS X via a
	  Homebrew package.  Hopefully &os; this will make it easier to share
	  more test infrastructure and scripts with OS X.</li>

	<li>&a.rodrigc; submitted to the Debian project a kyua
	  package.  Approval for this is still pending.  A package
	  will make it much easier to install kyua on Linux distributions which
	  use Debian packages such as Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint.  Hopefully
	  &os; this will make it easier to share more test infrastructure and
	  scripts with Linux.</li>

	<li>Brian Gardner submitted scripts to run the Regression Test
	  Harness for OpenJDK (jtreg).  The test results are in JUnit XML
	  format, which can be natively imported into Jenkins.</li>

	<li>Ahmed Kamal, an experienced devops expert, and past
	  contributor to the Ubuntu project, offered to help
	  &a.rodrigc; with improving the automation and deployment of
	  Jenkins nodes in the &os; cluster using the Saltstack automation
	  framework.  Ahmed is interested in helping the &os; project.</li>

	<li>&a.rodrigc; worked with &a.adrian; to set up Jenkins
	  builds of MIPS targets.  The next step will be to get kyua
	  tests running inside a QEMU MIPS VM.</li>

      <p>Mesa was upgraded to 10.3, then 10.4 for FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE and
	11-CURRENT.  We test release candidates and therefore this port is
	now usually updated shortly after a new release.  Mesa 10.x brings
	huge improvements in terms of OpenGL standards support, performance
	and stability, especially for Radeon owners.  Mesa 9.1 is kept for
	FreeBSD 9.x, but we have plans to fix this; see below.</p>

      <p><tt>graphics/gbm</tt> and <tt>devel/libclc</tt> are new ports used
	by Mesa to implement OpenCL.  The next step is to finish the port for
	Mesa's libOpenCL.so, named Clover.  This will permit users to run
	OpenCL programs on Radeon GPUs for now.</p>

      <p>xserver was upgraded from 1.12 to 1.14.  This is the last version
	of xserver supporting Mesa 9.1.  Changes are described in an article
	on the blog.  The most noticeable one is probably the switch from
	the input device detection back-end based on HAL to the one based on
	devd. hald(8) is still required by many desktop environments, but
	the X.Org server itself is free from it.</p>

      <p>xserver was the last port supporting the <tt>WITH_NEW_XORG</tt>
	knob.  The knob is now completely removed. This was the occasion to
	add <tt>WITH_NEW_XORG</tt> and <tt>WITH_KMS</tt> to the list of
	deprecated knobs to help people clean up their <tt>make.conf</tt>.
	At the same time, the new-xorg alternate pkg repository was
	deprecated.</p>

      <p>After discussion, two patent-encumbered options were enabled by
	default:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><tt>TEXTURE_FLOAT</tt> in graphics/dri, which allows Mesa to
	  advertise the support for OpenGL 3.0+;</li>
	<li><tt>LCD_FILTERING</tt> in print/freetype2, which enables the
	  subpixel rendering engine, improving font anti-aliasing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These two packages now provide a better user experience
	out-of-the-box.  Users who are uncomfortable with the options may
	unset them and rebuild the ports.  There is no need to rebuild
	anything else.</p>

      <p>On the kernel side, Tijl Coosemans added AGP support back to the
	TTM memory manager and therefore to the Radeon driver.  His work was
	merged back to stable/10 and will be available in FreeBSD
	10.2-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>We migrated our Ports development tree to Git and GitHub.  Tracking
	changes in the official Ports tree and preparing patches is way
	easier.  Furthermore, we can accept pull requests. All reasons behind
	this change are detailed on the blog and the workf-low is described
	on the wiki.</p>

      <p>The XDC 2014 (X Developer's Conference) was a great conference.
	Reviving the relationship with the developers of the graphics
	stack was a success! A report is available on the blog.</p>

      <p>Our next items on the roadmap are:</p>
      <ol>
	<li>Provide FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE's i915 driver to FreeBSD 9.x users
	  through a new port.  This is a work in progress, but it would allow
	  us to remove Mesa 9.1 and make Mesa 10.4 available everywhere.</li>
	<li>Once Mesa 9.1 is gone, we can update xserver to 1.16.</li>
      </ol>
