  <p>The &openjdk; project provides an open-source implementation of the &java;
    SE Platform and is available in versions 6 and 7 for all supported
    FreeBSD releases on the i386 and amd64 platforms.  Both versions can be
    installed by building from sources using the FreeBSD Ports Collection
    (<code>openjdk6</code> and <code>openjdk7</code>, respectively) and
    are also distributed as a prebuilt binary package via the FreeBSD mirrors
    and can be installed directly using <code>pkg(8)</code>.</p>

  <p>&openjdk; is the recommended &java; implementation on FreeBSD.
    The FreeBSD Foundation is no longer providing supported &java; &jdk; and
    &jre; packages based on Sun's partner sources.  Older packages for &java;
    &jdk; and &jre; 5.0 and 6.0 are still available below for reference and
    legacy use only, but are no longer supported.</p>

  <p>Further information about downloading the unsupported binaries is
    available from the
    <a href="http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/java">FreeBSD
    Foundation &java; Downloads</a> page.</p>

    &openjdk; 7 is frequently updated, and it is suggested to refer to a

    detailed release history. Additionally, one may choose to review more information at

    &openjdk; 6 is frequently updated, and it is suggested to refer to a

  <h3>... testing</h3>

  <p>The best thing you can do is download the latest release, install it, and try all your favorite Java applications.  If they don't work, see below.</p>

  <h3>... reporting a bug</h3>
  <p>If you find an application that does not work, or crashes, here are the steps you should follow before reporting it:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Try it again.</li>
    <li>Check your settings for this application.  Check to see if you made a mistake in starting it up.</li>
    <li>Try it on a different platform.  If you have access to a reference platform, try it there.  (We need to determine if it is an application error, a Java bug, or a FreeBSD specific bug.)</li>
    <li>Narrow down the problem.  If it is your own code, narrow down the bug to the offending code.  Otherwise, determine the steps required to reproduce the problem.</li>
    <li>Notify the JDK porting team.  Send email to <a href="mailto:freebsd-java@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-java@FreeBSD.org</a>.  Be sure to include the steps you have followed.</li>
    <li>Finally, and most importantly, be willing to work with the team to fix the problem.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>...writing documentation</h3>
  <p>Everyone can help here.  If you have a suggestion to add to the documentation, write it up and send it to <a href="mailto:freebsd-java@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-java@FreeBSD.org</a></p>
