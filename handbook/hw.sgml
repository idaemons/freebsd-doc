<chapt><heading>PC Hardware compatibility<label id="hw"></heading>

  <p>Issues of hardware compatibility are among the most
    troublesome in the computer industry today and FreeBSD is by
    no means immune to trouble.  In this respect, FreeBSD's
    advantage of being able to run on inexpensive commodity PC
    hardware is also its liability when it comes to support for
    the amazing variety of components on the market.  While it
    would be impossible to provide a exhaustive listing of
    hardware that FreeBSD supports, this section serves as a
    catalog of the device drivers included with FreeBSD and the
    hardware each drivers supports.  Where possible and
    appropriate, notes about specific products are included.
    You may also want to refer to <ref id="kernelconfig:config"
    name="the kernel configuration file"> section in this handbook for
    a list of supported devices.

    As FreeBSD is a volunteer project without a funded testing
    department, we depend on you, the user, for much of the
    information contained in this catalog.  If you have direct
    experience of hardware that does or does not work with
    FreeBSD, please let us know by sending e-mail to the &a.doc;.
    Questions about supported hardware
    should be directed to the &a.questions (see
    <ref id="eresources:mail" name="Mailing Lists"> for more
    information).  When submitting information or asking a
    question, please remember to specify exactly what version of
    FreeBSD you are using and include as many details of your
    hardware as possible.

<sect><heading>Resources on the Internet</heading>
<p>The following links have proven useful in selecting hardware.
Though some of what you see won't necessarily be specific (or even
applicable) to FreeBSD, most of the hardware information out there
is OS independent.  Please check with the FreeBSD hardware guide
to make sure that your chosen configuration is supported before
making any purchases.</p>

<sect><heading>Sample Configurations<label id="hw:configs"></heading>
<p>The following list of sample hardware configurations by no means
constitutes an endorsement of a given hardware vendor or product by
<em>The FreeBSD Project</em>.  This information is provided only as a public
service and merely catalogs some of the experiences that various individuals
have had with different hardware combinations.  Your mileage may vary.
Slippery when wet.  Beware of dog.

 <sect1><heading>Jordan's Picks<label id="hw:jordans-picks"></heading>
    <p>I have had fairly good luck building workstation and server
    configurations with the following components.  I can't guarantee that
    you will too, nor that any of the companies here will remain "best buys"
    forever.  I will try, when I can, to keep this list up-to-date but
    cannot obviously guarantee that it will be at any given time.

  <sect2><heading>Motherboards<label id="hw:mb"></heading>
    <p>For Pentium Pro (P6) systems, I'm quite fond of the
    <htmlurl url="http://www.tyan.com/html/products.html" name="Tyan">
    S1668 dual-processor motherboard.  It makes a dandy little single
    or dual processor system (which is supported in FreeBSD 3.0) and
    the price of the Pentium Pro 180/256K chip has fallen to truly
    affordable levels.  The Pentium Pro remains my favorite processor
    solution server systems (Megahertz ratings aren't everything).</p>

   <p>For the Pentium II, I'm rather partial to the <htmlurl
   url="http://www.asus.com.tw" name="ASUS"> <htmlurl
   url="http://www.asus.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Pentiumpro/P2l97-s/index.html" name="P2l97-S"> motherboard with the on-board Adaptec SCSI WIDE
   controller.</p>

   <p>For Pentium machines, the ASUS <htmlurl
     url="http://www.asus.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Pentium/P55tp4/index.html"
     name="P55T2P4">
    motherboard appears to be a good choice for mid-to-high range Pentium
    server and workstation systems.  You might also wish to investigate ASUS's
    <htmlurl url="http://asustek.asus.com.tw/FTP/ASUS/Info/Spec/pvi-486sp3.txt"
    name="486SP3G"> offering if it's a 486-class motherboard you're looking
    for (Note:  These have become increasingly hard to get as ASUS apparently
    no longer manufactures them).

    Those wishing to build more fault-tolerant systems should also be sure to
    use Parity memory or, for truly 24/7 applications, ECC memory.  Note
    that ECC memory does involve a slight performance trade-off (which may
    or may not be noticeable depending on your application) but buys you
    significantly increased fault-tolerance to memory errors.

  <sect2><heading>Disk Controllers</heading>
    <p>This one is a bit trickier, and while I used to recommend the
    <htmlurl url="http://www.buslogic.com" name="Buslogic"> controllers
    unilaterally for everything from ISA to PCI, now I tend to lean
    towards the <htmlurl url="http://www.adaptec.com" name="Adaptec">
    1542CF for ISA, Buslogic Bt747c for EISA and Adaptec 2940UW for PCI.

    The NCR/Symbios cards for PCI have also worked well for me, though
    you need to make sure that your motherboard supports the BIOS-less
    model if you're using one of those (if your card has nothing which
    looks even vaguely like a ROM chip on it, you've probably got one
    which expects its BIOS to be on your motherboard).

    <p>If you should find that you need more than one SCSI controller in a
    PCI machine, you may wish to consider conserving your scarce PCI
    bus resources by buying the Adaptec 3940 card, which puts two SCSI
    controllers (and internal busses) in a single slot.

  <sect2><heading>Disk drives<label id="hw:disks"></heading>
    <p>In this particular game of Russian roulette, I'll make few specific
    recommendations except to say "SCSI over IDE whenever you can afford it."
    Even in small desktop configurations, SCSI often makes more sense since it
    allows you to easily migrate drives from server to desktop as falling drive
    prices make it economical to do so.  If you have more than one machine
    to administer then think of it not simply as storage, think of it as a
    food chain!

    <p>I do not currently see SCSI WIDE drives as a necessary expense unless
    you're putting together an NFS or NEWS server that will be doing a lot
    of multiuser disk I/O.  

  <sect2><heading>CDROM drives<label id="hw:jordans-picks:cdrom"></heading>
    <p>My SCSI preferences extend to SCSI CDROM drives as well, and while
    the <htmlurl url="http://www.toshiba.com" name="Toshiba"> XM-3501B (also
    released in a caddy-less model called the XM-5401B) drive has always
    performed well for me, I'm now a great fan of the <htmlurl
    url="http://www.plextor.com" name="Plextor"> PX-12CS drive.  It's
    a 12 speed drive with excellent performance and reliability.

    <p>Generally speaking, most SCSI CDROM drives I've seen have been of
    pretty solid construction and you probably won't go wrong with an HP or
    NEC SCSI CDROM drive either.  SCSI CDROM prices also appear to have
    dropped considerably in the last few months and are now quite competitive
    with IDE CDROMs while remaining a technically superior solution.  I now see
    no reason whatsoever to settle for an IDE CDROM drive if given a choice
    between the two.


  <sect2><heading>CD Recordable (WORM) drives<label id="hw:worm"></heading>
    <p>At the time of this writing, FreeBSD supports 3 types of CDR drives
    (though I believe they all ultimately come from Phillips anyway):
    The Phillips CDD 522 (Acts like a Plasmon), the PLASMON RF4100 and
    the HP 6020i.  I myself use the HP 6020i for burning CDROMs (with
    2.2-current - it does not work with 2.1.5 or earlier releases of the
    SCSI code) and it works very well.  See <htmlurl
    url="file:/usr/share/examples/worm" name="/usr/share/examples/worm">
    on your 2.2 system for example scripts used to created ISO9660
    filesystem images (with RockRidge extensions) and burn them onto an
    HP6020i CDR.

  <sect2><heading>Tape drives<label id="hw:tape"></heading>
   <p>I've had pretty good luck with both
   <htmlurl url="http://www.Exabyte.COM:80/Products/8mm/8505XL/Rfeatures.html"
   name="8mm drives"> from <htmlurl url="http://www.exabyte.com"
   name="Exabyte"> and 
   <htmlurl url="http://www-dmo.external.hp.com:80/tape/_cpb0001.htm" 
   name="4mm (DAT)"> drives from <htmlurl url="http://www.hp.com" name="HP">.
   
   <p>For backup purposes, I'd have to give the higher recommendation to the
   Exabyte due to the more robust nature (and higher storage capacity) of
   8mm tape.

  <sect2><heading>Video Cards<label id="hw:video"></heading>
    <p>If you can also afford to buy a commercial X server for US&dollar;99
    from <htmlurl url="http://www.xig.com/"
    name="Xi Graphics, Inc. (formerly X Inside, Inc)"> then I can heartily
    recommend the <htmlurl url="http://www.matrox.com/" name="Matrox">
    <htmlurl url="http://www.matrox.com/mgaweb/brochure.htm"
    name="Millenium"> card.  Note that support for this card is also
    excellent with the <htmlurl url="http://www.xfree86.org/"
    name="XFree86"> server, which is now at version 3.3.2.

    You also certainly can't go wrong with one of
    <htmlurl url="http://www.nine.com/" name="Number 9's"> cards -
    their S3 Vision 868 and 968 based cards (the 9FX series) also being
    quite fast and very well supported by XFree86's S3 server.

  <sect2><heading>Monitors<label id="hw:monitors"></heading>
    <p>I have had very good luck with the <htmlurl url="http://cons3.sel.sony.com/SEL/ccpg/display/ms17se2.html"
    name="Sony Multiscan 17seII monitors">, as have I with 
    the Viewsonic offering in the same (Trinitron) tube.  For larger than
    17", all I can recommend at the time of this writing is to not spend
    any less than U.S. &dollar;2,500 for a 21" monitor or
    &dollar;1,700 for a 20" monitor if that's what you really
    need.  There are good monitors available in the >=20" range and there
    are also cheap monitors in the >=20" range.  Unfortunately, very few are
    both cheap and good!

  <sect2><heading>Networking<label id="hw:networking"></heading>
    <p>I can recommend the <htmlurl url="http://www.smc.com/" name="SMC">
    Ultra 16 controller for any ISA application and the SMC EtherPower
    or Compex ENET32 cards for any serious PCI based networking.  Both of
    the PCI cards are based around DEC's DC21041 Ethernet controller
    chip and other cards using it, such as the Zynx ZX342 or DEC DE435,
    will generally work as well.  For 100Mbit networking, either the
    SMC SMC9332DST 10/100MB or Intel EtherExpress Pro/100B cards will do
    a fine job, the Intel EtherExpress generally getting my vote.

    If what you're looking for is, on the other hand, the cheapest possible
    solution which will still work reasonably well, then almost any NE2000
    clone is a good choice.


   <sect2><heading>Serial<label id="hw:serial"></heading>
    <p>If you're looking for high-speed serial networking solutions, then
    <htmlurl url="http://www.dgii.com/" name="Digi International">
    makes the <htmlurl url="http://www.dgii.com/prodprofiles/profiles-prices/digiprofiles/digispecs/sync570.html" name="SYNC/570"> series, with drivers now in
    FreeBSD-current. <htmlurl url="http://www.etinc.com"
    name="Emerging Technologies"> also manufactures a board with T1/E1
    capabilities, using software they provide.  I have no direct experience
    using either product, however.

    <p>Multiport card options are somewhat more numerous, though it has to be
    said that FreeBSD's support for <htmlurl url="http://www.cyclades.com/"
    name="Cyclades">'s products is probably the tightest, primarily as a result
    of that company's commitment to making sure that we are adequately supplied
    with evaluation boards and technical specs.  I've heard that the Cyclom-16Ye
    offers the best price/performance, though I've not checked the prices lately.
    Other multiport cards I've heard good things about are the BOCA and AST
    cards, and <htmlurl url="http://www.stallion.com/" name="Stallion
    Technologies"> apparently offers an unofficial driver for their 
    cards at <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.stallion.com/drivers/unsupported/freebsd/stalbsd-0.0.4.tar.gz" name="this"> location.

   <sect2><heading>Audio<label id="hw:audio"></heading>
   <p>I currently use a <htmlurl url="http://www.creaf.com/" name="Creative Labs"> AWE32 though just about anything from Creative Labs will generally work these days.  This is not to say that other types of sound cards don't also work, simply that I have little experience with them (I was a former GUS fan, but Gravis's soundcard situation has been dire for some time).</p>

   <sect2><heading>Video<label id="hw:vgrabbers"></heading>
   <p>For video capture, there are two good choices - any card
   based on the Brooktree BT848 chip, such as the Hauppage or WinTV
   boards, will work very nicely with FreeBSD.  Another board which works
   for me is the
   <htmlurl url="http://www.matrox.com/" name="Matrox">
   <htmlurl url="http://www.matrox.com/imgweb/meteor.htm" name="Meteor">
   card.  FreeBSD also supports the older video spigot card from
   Creative Labs, but those are getting somewhat difficult to find.
   Note that the Meteor frame grabber card <em>will not work</em>
   with motherboards based on the 440FX chipset!  See the
   <ref id="hw:mb" name="motherboard reference"> section for details.
   In such cases, it's better to go with a BT848 based board.</p>

	  <p><descrip>

	      <tag>Mercury:</tag> Cache coherency problems,
		especially if there are ISA bus masters behind
		the ISA to PCI bridge chip.  Hardware flaw, only

		off.

	      <tag>Saturn-I <em>(ie, 82424ZX at rev 0, 1 or 2)</em>:</tag>
		Write back cache coherency
		problems.  Hardware flaw, only known work around
		is to set the external cache to write-through
		mode.  Upgrade to Saturn-II.

	      <tag>Saturn-II <em>(ie, 82424ZX at rev 3 or 4)</em>:</tag>
                Works fine, but many MB
		manufactures leave out the external dirty bit
		SRAM needed for write back operation.  Work
		arounds are either run it in write through mode,
		or get the dirty bit SRAM installed.  (I have
		these for the ASUS PCI/I-486SP3G rev 1.6 and
		later boards).

	      <tag>Neptune:</tag> Can not run more than 2 bus
		master devices.  Admitted Intel design flaw.
		Workarounds include do not run more than 2 bus
		masters, special hardware design to replace the
		PCI bus arbiter (appears on Intel Altair board
		and several other Intel server group MB's).  And
		of course Intel's official answer, move to the
		Triton chip set, we ``fixed it there''.

	      <tag>Triton <em>(ie, 430FX)</em>:</tag>
		No known cache coherency or bus
		master problems, chip set does not implement
		parity checking.  Workaround for parity issue.
		Use Triton-II based motherboards if you have the choice.

	      <tag>Triton-II <em>(ie, 430HX)</em>:</tag>
		All reports on motherboards using
		this chipset have been favorable so far.  No known
		problems.

	      <tag>Orion:</tag> Early versions of this chipset suffered from
	 	a PCI write-posting bug which can cause noticeable performance
		degradation in applications where large amounts of PCI bus
		traffic is involved.  B0 stepping or later revisions of the
		chipset fixed this problem.

  <p><em>Contributed by &a.asami;.<newline>26 December 1997.</em></p>
  <sect2><heading>P6 class (Pentium Pro/Pentium II)</heading>
     <p>Both the Pentium Pro and Pentium II work fine with FreeBSD.
       In fact, our main ftp site <htmlurl
       url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/" name="ftp.freebsd.org"> (also
       known as "<tt>ftp.cdrom.com</tt>", world's largest ftp site)
       runs FreeBSD on a Pentium Pro.  <htmlurl
       url="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/archive-info/wcarchive.txt"
       name="Configurations details"> are available for
       interested parties.

  <sect2><heading>Pentium class</heading>
     <p>The Intel Pentium (P54C), Pentium MMX (P55C), AMD K6 and
       Cyrix/IBM 6x86MX processors are all reported to work with
       FreeBSD.  I will not go into details of which processor is
       faster than what, there are zillions of web sites on the
       Internet that tells you one way or another. <tt>:)</tt>

     <p>Note that various CPUs have different voltage/cooling
       requirements.  Make sure your motherboard can supply the exact
       voltage needed by the CPU.  For instance, many recent MMX chips
       require split voltage (e.g., 2.9V core, 3.3V I/O).  Also, some
       AMD and Cyrix/IBM chips run hotter than Intel chips.  In that
       case, make sure you have good heatsink/fans (you can get the
       list of certified parts from their web pages).

     <sect3><heading>Clock speeds</heading>
     <p><em>Contributed by &a.rgrimes;.<newline>1 October 1996.</em></p>
     <p><em>Updated by &a.asami;.<newline>27 December 1997.</em></p>
       <p>Pentium class machines use different clock speeds for the various
         parts of the system.  These being the speed of the CPU, external
	 memory bus, and the PCI bus.  It is not always true that a "faster"
	 processor will make a system faster than a "slower" one, due to
	 the various clock speeds used.
	 Below is a table showing the differences:
       <p>
       <tscreen><verb>
         Rated External Clock  External to     PCI Bus
          CPU  and Memory Bus  Internal Clock  Clock

          233  66              3.5             33

	 *  The Pentium 100 can be run at either 50MHz external clock with
	    a multiplier of 2 or at 66MHz and a multiplier of 1.5.
	 ** 66 MHz may actually be 66.667 MHz, but don't assume so.
       </verb></tscreen>
       <p>As can be seen the best parts to be using are the 100, 133, 166,
         200 and 233, with the exception that at a multiplier of 3 or more 
         the CPU starves for memory.

     <sect3><heading>The AMD K6 Bug</heading>
       <p>In 1997, there have been reports of the AMD K6 seg faulting
         during heavy compilation.  That problem has been fixed in 3Q '97.
         According to reports, K6 chips with date mark "9733" or
         larger (i.e., manufactured in the 33rd week of '97 or later)
         do not have this bug.

    <p>Sorry, FreeBSD does not run on 80286 machines.  It is nearly
      impossible to run today's large full-featured UNIXes on such
      hardware.

<sect1><heading>* Memory</heading>
  <p>The minimum amount of memory you must have to install FreeBSD is 5 MB.
    Once your system is up and running you can <ref id="kernelconfig:building"
    name="build a custom kernel"> that will use less memory.
    If you use the boot4.flp you can get away with having only 4 MB.

	<p>There are several different interfaces that support
tape drives.  The interfaces are SCSI, IDE, Floppy and Parallel
Port.  A wide variety of tape drives are available for these
interfaces.  Controllers are discussed in
	 <ref id="hw:storage:controllers" name="Disk/tape controllers">

  <sect2><heading> SCSI drives</heading>
       <p>The <tt>st(4)</tt> driver provides support for 8mm
	(Exabyte), 4mm (DAT: Digital Audio Tape), QIC (Quarter-Inch
	Cartridge), DLT (Digital Linear Tape), QIC Minicartridge
	and 9-track (remember the big reels that you see spinning
	in Hollywood computer rooms) tape drives. See the
	<tt>st(4)</tt> manual page for a detailed description. 

	<p>The drives listed below are currently being used by
members of the FreeBSD community.  They are not the only drives
that will work with FreeBSD.  They just happen to be the ones
that we use.

	<p>Data transfer rate is 80kB/s.
	<p>IBM and Emerald units will not work.  Replacing the
firmware EPROM of these units will solve the problem.

	<p>The boot message identifier for this drive is
"TANDBERG  TDC 4222 =07" "type 1 removable SCSI 2"
	<p>This is a QIC tape drive.
	<p>Native capacity is 2.5GB.  The drive will read all
cartridges from the 60 MB (DC600A) upwards, and write 150 MB
(DC6150) upwards.  Hardware compression is optionally supported
for the 2.5 GB cartridges.
	<p>This drives quirks are known and pre-compiled into the
scsi tape device driver (<tt>st(4)</tt>) beginning with FreeBSD
2.2-current.  For previous versions of FreeBSD, use <tt>mt</tt>
to read one block from the tape, rewind the tape, and then
execute the backup program (<tt>mt fsr 1; mt rewind; dump ...</tt>)
	<p>Data transfer rate is 600kB/s (vendor claim with compression),
	350 KB/s can even be reached in start/stop mode.  The rate
	decreases for smaller cartridges.

	<p>The boot message identifier for this drive is "WANGTEK
5525ES SCSI REV7 3R1" "type 1 removable SCSI 1" "density code 0x11, 1024-byte
blocks"
	<p>This is a QIC tape drive.
	<p>Native capacity is 525MB.
	<p>Data transfer rate is 180kB/s.
	<p>The drive reads 60, 120, 150, and 525MB tapes.  The
drive will not write 60MB (DC600 cartridge) tapes.  In order to
overwrite 120 and 150 tapes reliably, first erase (<tt>mt
erase</tt>) the tape.  120 and 150 tapes used a wider track
(fewer tracks per tape) than 525MB tapes. The "extra" width of
the previous tracks is not overwritten, as a result the new data
lies in a band surrounded on both sides by the previous data
unless the tape have been erased.

	<p>As mentioned in
	<ref id="hw:jordans-picks:cdrom" name="Jordan's Picks"> 
    Generally speaking those in <em>The FreeBSD Project</em> prefer SCSI
    CDROM drives over IDE CDROM drives.  However not all SCSI CDROM drives
	are equal.  Some feel the quality of some SCSI CDROM drives have been
	deteriorating to that of IDE CDROM drives.  Toshiba used to be the
	favored stand-by, but many on the SCSI mailing list have found
	displeasure with the 12x speed XM-5701TA as its volume (when playing
	audio CDROMs) is not controllable by the various audio player software.

	Another area where SCSI CDROM manufacturers are cutting corners is
	adhearance to the 
	<ref id="scsi:further-reading" name="SCSI specification">.  Many SCSI
	CDROMs will respond to
	<ref id="scsi:rogue-devices" name="multiple LUNs"> for its target address.
	Known violators include the 6x Teac CD-56S 1.0D.
