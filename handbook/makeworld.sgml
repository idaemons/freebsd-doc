This document is a placeholder for the "How to run 'make world'" section.
Currently, it just links to my tutorial. It is intended that, once the
Handbook has been converted, the tutorial referenced here will be slightly
rewritten and used here.

    <p>Once you have synchronised your local source tree against a particular
      version of FreeBSD (<tt>stable</tt>, <tt>current</tt> and so on) you
      must then use the source tree to rebuild the system.</p>

    <p>Currently, the best source of information on how to do that is a
      tutorial available from <htmlurl
        url="http://www.nothing-going-on.demon.co.uk/FreeBSD/make-world/make-world.html" name="http://www.nothing-going-on.demon.co.uk/FreeBSD/make-world/make-world.html">.</p>

    <p>A successor to this tutorial will be integrated into the handbook.</p>
