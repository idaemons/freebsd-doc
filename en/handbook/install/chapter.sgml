      <title>Installing FreeBSD</title>
      
      <para>So, you would like to try out FreeBSD on your system? This section
	is a quick-start guide for what you need to do. FreeBSD can be
	installed from a variety of media including CD-ROM, floppy disk,
	magnetic tape, an MS-DOS partition and, if you have a network
	connection, via anonymous ftp or NFS.</para>
      
      <para>Regardless of the installation media you choose, you can get
	started by creating the <emphasis>installation
	  disk</emphasis> as described below. Booting your computer into the
	FreeBSD installer, even if you aren't planning on installing FreeBSD
	right away, will provide important information about compatibility
	between FreeBSD and your hardware which may, in turn, dictate which
	installation options are even possible. It can also provide early
	clues to any compatibility problems which could prevent FreeBSD
	running on your system at all.</para>

    <para>If you plan on installing via
	anonymous FTP then this installation floppy is all you need to
      download and create&mdash;the installation program itself will handle
      any further required downloading directly (using an ethernet connection,
      a modem and ppp dialip #, etc).</para>
      
      <para>For more information on obtaining the latest FreeBSD
	distributions, please see <link linkend="mirrors">Obtaining
	  FreeBSD</link> in the
	Appendix.</para>
      
      <para>So, to get the show on the road, follow these steps:</para>
      
	<procedure>
	  
	  <step>
	    <para>Review the <link linkend="install-hw">supported
		configurations</link> section of this installation guide to be sure
	      that your hardware is supported by FreeBSD. It may be helpful
	      to make a list of any special cards you have installed, such as
	      SCSI controllers, Ethernet adapters or sound cards. This list
	      should include relevant configuration parameters such as
	      interrupts (IRQ) and IO port addresses.</para>
	  </step>
	  
	  <step>
	    <para>If you're installing FreeBSD from CDROM media then you have
	      several different installation options:</para>
	      <itemizedlist>
		
		<listitem>
		  <para>If the CD has been mastered with El Torrito boot
		    support and your system supports direct booting from CDROM
		    (and many older systems do <emphasis>not</emphasis>),
		    simply insert the CD into the drive and boot directly from
		    it.</para>
		</listitem>
		
		<listitem>
		  <para>If you're running DOS and have the proper drivers to
		    access your CD, run the install.bat script provided on the
		    CD. This will attempt to boot into the FreeBSD
		    installation straight from DOS.</para>

		  <note>
		    <para>You must do this from actual DOS and not a Windows
		      DOS box.</para>
		  </note>

		  <para>If you also want to install FreeBSD
		    from your DOS partition (perhaps because your CDROM drive
		    is completely unsupported by FreeBSD) then run the setup
		    program first to copy the appropriate files from the CD to
		    your DOS partition, afterwards running install.</para>
		</listitem>
		
		<listitem>
		  <para>If either of the two proceeding methods work then you
		    can simply skip the rest of this section, otherwise your
		    final option is to create a boot floppy from the
		    <filename>floppies\boot.flp</filename> image&mdash;proceed to
		    step 4 for instructions on how to do this.</para>
		</listitem>
		
	      </itemizedlist>

	  </step>
	  
	  <step>
	    <para>If you don't have a CDROM distribution then simply download
	      the <ulink
		URL="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/&rel.current;-RELEASE/floppies/boot.flp">installation boot disk image</ulink> file to your hard drive, being sure to tell your browser to <emphasis>save</emphasis> rather than <emphasis>display</emphasis> the file.</para>

	    <note>
	      <para>This disk image can only be used with 1.44 megabyte 3.5
		inch floppy disks.</para>
	    </note>
	  </step>
	  
	  <step>
	    <para>Make the installation boot disk from the image file:</para>
	      <itemizedlist>
		
		<listitem>
		  <para>If you are using MS-DOS then download  <ulink
		      URL="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/tools/fdimage.exe">fdimage.exe</ulink> or get it from <filename>tools\fdimage.exe</filename> on the CDROM and then run it like so:</para>

		    <informalexample>
		      <screen><prompt>E:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>tools\fdimage floppies\boot.flp a:</userinput></screen>
		    </informalexample>
	      <para>The <emphasis>fdimage</emphasis>
		    program will format the <devicename>A:</devicename> drive and then copy the
		    <filename>boot.flp</filename> image onto it (assuming that you're at the top
		    level of a FreeBSD distribution and the floppy images live
		    in the floppies subdirectory, as is typically the
		    case).</para>
		</listitem>
		
		<listitem>
		  <para>If you are using a UNIX system to create the floppy
		    image:</para>

		    <informalexample>
		      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=boot.flp of=<replaceable>disk_device</replaceable></userinput></screen>
		    </informalexample>
	      <para><replaceable>disk_device</replaceable> is
		    the <filename>/dev</filename> entry for the floppy drive.
		    On FreeBSD systems, this is <filename>/dev/rfd0</filename>
		    for the <devicename>A:</devicename> drive and <filename>/dev/rfd1</filename> for
		    the <devicename>B:</devicename> drive.</para>
		</listitem>
		
	      </itemizedlist>
	  </step>
	  
	  <step>
	    <para>With the installation disk in the A: drive, reboot your
	      computer. You should get a boot prompt something like this:</para>
	      <informalexample>
		<screen>
&gt;&gt; FreeBSD BOOT ...
Usage: [[[0:][wd](0,a)]/kernel][-abcCdhrsv]
Use 1:sd(0,a)kernel to boot sd0 if it is BIOS drive 1
Use ? for file list or press Enter for defaults
Boot:
		</screen>
	      </informalexample>
	  <para>If you do <emphasis>not</emphasis> type
	      anything, FreeBSD will automatically boot with its default
	      configuration after a delay of about five seconds. As FreeBSD
	      boots, it probes your computer to determine what hardware is
	      installed. The results of this probing is displayed on the
	      screen.</para>
	  </step>
	  
	  <step>
	    <para>When the booting process is finished, The main FreeBSD
	      installation menu will be displayed.</para>
	  </step>
	  
	</procedure>
      
      <para><emphasis>If something goes wrong...</emphasis></para>
      
      <para>Due to limitations of the PC architecture, it is impossible for
	probing to be 100 percent reliable. In the event that your hardware
	is incorrectly identified, or that the probing causes your computer to
	lock up, first check the
	<link linkend="install-hw">supported       configurations</link>
	section of this installation guide to be sure that your hardware is
	indeed supported by FreeBSD.</para>
      
      <para>If your hardware is supported, reset the computer and when the
	<prompt>Boot:</prompt> prompt comes up, type
	<literal>-c</literal>. This puts FreeBSD into a configuration mode
	where you can supply hints about your hardware. The FreeBSD kernel on
	the installation disk is configured assuming that most hardware
	devices are in their factory default configuration in terms of IRQs,
	IO addresses and DMA channels. If your hardware has been
	reconfigured, you will most likely need to use the <option>-c</option>
	option at boot to tell FreeBSD where things are.</para>
      
      <para>It is also possible that a probe for a device not present will
	cause a later probe for another device that is present to fail. In
	that case, the probes for the conflicting driver(s) should be
	disabled.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>Do not disable any device you will need during installation, such
	as your screen (<devicename>sc0</devicename>).</para>
    </warning>
      
      <para>In the configuration mode, you can:</para>
      
      
	<itemizedlist>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>List the device drivers installed in the kernel.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Disable device drivers for hardware not present in your
	      system.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Change the IRQ, DRQ, and IO port addresses used by a device
	      driver.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	</itemizedlist>
      
      
      <para>While at the <prompt>config&gt;</prompt> prompt, type
	<command>help</command> for more information on the
	available commands. After adjusting the kernel to match how you have
	your hardware configured, type <command>quit</command> at
	the <prompt>config&gt;</prompt> prompt to continue
	booting with the new settings.</para>
      
      <para>After FreeBSD has been installed, changes made in the
	configuration mode will be permanent so you do not have to reconfigure
	every time you boot. Even so, it is likely that you will want to
	build a custom kernel to optimize the performance of your system. See
	<link linkend="kernelconfig"
	 >Kernel configuration</link> for more information on creating
	custom kernels.</para>

	<title>Preparing for the Installation</title>
	
	<para>There are a number of different methods by which FreeBSD can be
	  installed. The following describes what preparation needs to be
	  done for each type.</para>
	
	
	<sect2>
	  <title>Before installing from CDROM</title>
	  
	  <para>If your CDROM is of an unsupported type, then please skip to
	    <link linkend="install-msdos">MS-DOS
	      Preparation</link>.</para>
	  
	  <para>There is not a lot of preparatory work that needs to be done
	    to successfully install from one of Walnut Creek's FreeBSD CDROMs
	    (other CDROM distributions may work as well, though we cannot say
	    for certain as we have no hand or say in how they are created).
	    You can either boot into the CD installation directly from DOS
	    using Walnut Creek's supplied <filename>install.bat</filename> batch file or you
	    can make a boot floppy with the <filename>makeflp.bat</filename> command.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>If you are running FreeBSD 2.1-RELEASE and have an IDE
	      CDROM, use the <filename>inst_ide.bat</filename> or <filename>atapiflp.bat</filename> batch files
	      instead.</para>
	  </note>
	  
	  <para>For the easiest interface of all (from DOS), type <command>view</command>.
	    This will bring up a DOS menu utility that leads you through all
	    the available options.</para>
	  
	  <para>If you are creating the boot floppy from a UNIX machine, see
	    <link linkend="install">the beginning of this
	      guide</link> for examples. of how to create the boot floppy.</para>
	  
	  <para>Once you have booted from DOS or floppy, you should then be
	    able to select CDROM as the media type in the Media menu and load
	    the entire distribution from CDROM. No other types of
	    installation media should be required.</para>
	  
	  <para>After your system is fully installed and you have rebooted
	    from the hard disk, you can mount the CDROM at any time by typing:
	    <command>mount /cdrom</command></para>
	  
	  <para>Before removing the CD again, also note that it is necessary
	    to first type: <command>umount /cdrom</command>. Do not just
	    remove it from the drive!</para>
	  
	  <note>
	    <para>Before invoking the installation, be sure that the CDROM is
	      in the drive so that the install probe can find it. This is
	      also true if you wish the CDROM to be added to the default
	      system configuration automatically during the install (whether
	      or not you actually use it as the installation media).</para>
	  </note>
	  
	  <para>Finally, if you would like people to be able to FTP install
	    FreeBSD directly from the CDROM in your machine, you will find it
	    quite easy. After the machine is fully installed, you simply need
	    to add the following line to the password file (using the vipw
	    command):</para>
	  
	  <programlisting>
ftp:*:99:99::0:0:FTP:/cdrom:/nonexistent</programlisting>
	  
	  <para>Anyone with network connectivity to your machine (and
	    permission to log into it) can now chose a Media type of FTP and
	    type in: <userinput>ftp://<replaceable>your
		machine</replaceable></userinput> after picking &ldquo;Other&rdquo; in
	    the ftp sites menu.</para>
	  
	</sect2>
	
	<sect2>
	  <title>Before installing from Floppy</title>
	  
	  <para>If you must install from floppy disks, either due to
	    unsupported hardware or simply because you enjoy doing things the
	    hard way, you must first prepare some floppies for the
	    install.</para>
	  
	  <para>You will need, at minimum, as many 1.44MB or 1.2MB floppies as
	    it takes to hold all files in the bin (binary distribution)
	    directory. If you are preparing these floppies under DOS, then
	    THESE floppies <emphasis>must</emphasis> be formatted using the MS-DOS FORMAT
	    command. If you are using Windows, use the Windows File Manager
	    format command.</para>
	  
	  <para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> trust Factory Preformatted
	    floppies! Format them again yourself, just to make sure. Many
	    problems reported by our users in the past have resulted from the
	    use of improperly formatted media, which is why I am taking such
	    special care to mention it here!</para>
	  
	  <para>If you are creating the floppies from another FreeBSD machine,
	    a format is still not a bad idea though you do not need to put a
	    DOS filesystem on each floppy. You can use the <command>disklabel</command> and
	    <command>newfs</command> commands to put a UFS filesystem on them instead, as the
	    following sequence of commands (for a 3.5" 1.44MB floppy disk)
	    illustrates:</para>
	  
	  
	    <informalexample>
	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fdformat -f 1440 fd0.1440</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>disklabel -w -r fd0.1440 floppy3</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs -t 2 -u 18 -l 1 -i 65536 /dev/rfd0</userinput>
	      </screen>
	    </informalexample>
	  

	  <note>
	    <para>Use <literal>fd0.1200</literal> and
	      <literal>floppy5</literal> for 5.25" 1.2MB disks.</para>
	  </note>
		  
	  <para>Then you can mount and write to them like any other file
	    system.</para>
	  
	  <para>After you have formatted the floppies, you will need to copy
	    the files onto them. The distribution files are split into chunks
	    conveniently sized so that 5 of them will fit on a conventional
	    1.44MB floppy. Go through all your floppies, packing as many
	    files as will fit on each one, until you have got all the
	    distributions you want packed up in this fashion. Each
	    distribution should go into a subdirectory on the floppy, e.g.:
	    <filename>a:\bin\bin.aa</filename>,
	    <filename>a:\bin\bin.ab</filename>, and so on.</para>
	  
	  <para>Once you come to the Media screen of the install, select
	    &ldquo;Floppy&rdquo; and you will be prompted for the rest.</para>
	  
	</sect2>
	
	<sect2 id="install-msdos">
	  <title>Before installing from a MS-DOS partition</title>
	  
	  <para>To prepare for installation from an MS-DOS partition, copy the
	    files from the distribution into a directory called
	    <filename>C:\FREEBSD</filename>. The directory tree structure of
	    the CDROM must be partially reproduced within this directory so we
	    suggest using the DOS <command>xcopy</command> command.
	    For example, to prepare for a minimal installation of FreeBSD:</para>

	    <informalexample>
	      <screen><prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>MD C:\FREEBSD</userinput>
<prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>XCOPY /S E:\BIN C:\FREEBSD\BIN\</userinput>
<prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>XCOPY /S E:\MANPAGES C:\FREEBSD\MANPAGES\</userinput></screen>
	    </informalexample>

	  <para>Assuming that <devicename>C:</devicename>
	    is where you have free space and <devicename>E:</devicename>
	    is where your CDROM is mounted.</para>
	  
	  <para>For as many <abbrev>DISTS</abbrev> you wish to install from MS-DOS (and you
	    have free space for), install each one under
	    <filename>C:\FREEBSD</filename> &mdash; the <abbrev>BIN</abbrev> dist
	    is only the minimal requirement.</para>
	  
	</sect2>
	
	<sect2>
	  <title>Before installing from QIC/SCSI Tape</title>
	  
	  <para>Installing from tape is probably the easiest method, short of
	    an on-line install using FTP or a CDROM install. The installation
	    program expects the files to be simply tar'ed onto the tape, so
	    after getting all of the files for distribution you are interested
	    in, simply tar them onto the tape with a command like:</para>

	    <informalexample>
	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /freebsd/distdir</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tar cvf /dev/rwt0 dist1 ... dist2</userinput></screen>
	    </informalexample>

	  
	  <para>When you go to do the installation, you should also make sure
	    that you leave enough room in some temporary directory (which you
	    will be allowed to choose) to accommodate the <emphasis>full</emphasis> contents of the tape you have created.
	    Due to the non-random access nature of tapes, this method of
	    installation requires quite a bit of temporary storage. You
	    should expect to require as much temporary storage as you have
	    stuff written on tape.</para>
	  
	  <note>
	      <para>When going to do the installation, the tape must be in the
	      drive <emphasis>before</emphasis> booting from the boot floppy.
	      The installation probe may otherwise fail to find it.</para>
	  </note>
	  
	</sect2>
	
	<sect2>
	  <title>Before installing over a network</title>
	  
	  <para>You can do network installations over 3 types of
	    communications links:</para>
	  
	    <variablelist>
	      <varlistentry><term>Serial port</term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>SLIP or PPP</para>
		  
		</listitem>
	      </varlistentry>
	      
	      <varlistentry><term>Parallel port</term>
		
		<listitem>
		  <para>PLIP (laplink cable)</para>
		  
		</listitem>
	      </varlistentry>
	      
	      <varlistentry><term>Ethernet</term>
		
		<listitem>
		  <para>A standard ethernet controller (includes some
		    PCMCIA).</para>
		  
		</listitem>
	      </varlistentry>
	    </variablelist>
	  
	  <para>SLIP support is rather primitive, and limited primarily to
	    hard-wired links, such as a serial cable running between a laptop
	    computer and another computer. The link should be hard-wired as
	    the SLIP installation does not currently offer a dialing
	    capability; that facility is provided with the PPP utility, which
	    should be used in preference to SLIP whenever possible.</para>
	  
	  <para>If you are using a modem, then PPP is almost certainly your
	    only choice. Make sure that you have your service provider's
	    information handy as you will need to know it fairly soon in the
	    installation process. You will need to know how to dial your ISP
	    using the &ldquo;AT commands&rdquo; specific to your modem, as the PPP
	    dialer provides only a very simple terminal emulator. If you're
	    using PAP or CHAP, you'll need to type the necessary <command>set
	    authname</command> and <command>set authkey</command> commands before typing <command>term</command>.
	    Refer to the user-ppp <link linkend="userppp">handbook</link>
	    and <ulink URL="../FAQ/userppp.html">FAQ</ulink> entries for
	    further information. If you have problems, logging can be
	    directed to the screen using the command <command>set
	      log local ...</command>.</para>
	  
	  <para>If a hard-wired connection to another FreeBSD (2.0R or later)
	    machine is available, you might also consider installing over a
	    &ldquo;laplink&rdquo; parallel port cable. The data rate over the parallel
	    port is much higher than what is typically possible over a serial
	    line (up to 50k/sec), thus resulting in a quicker
	    installation.</para>
	  
	  <para>Finally, for the fastest possible network installation, an
	    ethernet adaptor is always a good choice! FreeBSD supports most
	    common PC ethernet cards, a table of supported cards (and their
	    required settings) is provided in <link linkend="install-hw"
	     >Supported
	      Hardware</link>. If you are using one of the supported PCMCIA
	    ethernet cards, also be sure that it is plugged in
	    <emphasis>before</emphasis> the laptop is powered on! FreeBSD
	    does not, unfortunately, currently support hot insertion of PCMCIA
	    cards during installation.</para>
	  
	  <para>You will also need to know your IP address on the network, the
	    netmask value for your address class, and the name of your
	    machine. Your system administrator can tell you which values to
	    use for your particular network setup. If you will be referring
	    to other hosts by name rather than IP address, you will also need
	    a name server and possibly the address of a gateway (if you are
	    using PPP, it is your provider's IP address) to use in talking to
	    it. If you do not know the answers to all or most of these
	    questions, then you should really probably talk to your system
	    administrator <emphasis>first</emphasis> before trying this type
	    of installation.</para>
	  
	  <para>Once you have a network link of some sort working, the
	    installation can continue over NFS or FTP.</para>
	  
	  
	  <sect3>
	    <title>Preparing for NFS installation</title>
	    
	    <para>NFS installation is fairly straight-forward: Simply copy the
	      FreeBSD distribution files you want onto a server somewhere and
	      then point the NFS media selection at it.</para>
	    
	    <para>If this server supports only &ldquo;privileged port&rdquo; access (as
	      is generally the default for Sun workstations), you will need to
	      set this option in the Options menu before installation can
	      proceed.</para>
	    
	    <para>If you have a poor quality ethernet card which suffers from
	      very slow transfer rates, you may also wish to toggle the
	      appropriate Options flag.</para>
	    
	    <para>In order for NFS installation to work, the server must
	      support subdir mounts, e.g., if your FreeBSD &rel.current;
	      distribution directory lives on:
	      <filename>ziggy:/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename> Then <hostid>ziggy</hostid>
	      will have to allow the direct mounting of
	      <filename>/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>, not just
	      <filename>/usr</filename> or
	      <filename>/usr/archive/stuff</filename>.</para>
	    
	    <para>In FreeBSD's <filename>/etc/exports</filename> file, this is
	      controlled by the <option>-alldirs</option> option. Other
	      NFS servers may have different conventions. If you are getting
	      <errortype>Permission Denied</errortype> messages from the server then it is likely
	      that you do not have this enabled properly.</para>
	    
	  </sect3>
	  
	  <sect3>
	    <title>Preparing for FTP Installation</title>
	    
	    <para>FTP installation may be done from any mirror site containing
	      a reasonably up-to-date version of FreeBSD &rel.current;. A
	      full menu of reasonable choices from almost anywhere in the
	      world is provided by the FTP site menu.</para>
	    
	    <para>If you are installing from some other FTP site not listed in
	      this menu, or you are having troubles getting your name server
	      configured properly, you can also specify your own URL by
	      selecting the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; choice in that menu. A URL can also be
	      a direct IP address, so the following would work in the absence
	      of a name server:</para>
	    
	    
	      <informalexample>
		<screen><userinput>ftp://165.113.121.81/pub/FreeBSD/&rel.current;-RELEASE</userinput></screen>
	      </informalexample>
	    
	    
	    <para>There are two FTP installation modes you can use:</para>
	    
	    
	      <variablelist>
		<varlistentry><term>FTP Active</term>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>For all FTP transfers, use &ldquo;Active&rdquo; mode. This
		      will not work through firewalls, but will often work
		      with older ftp servers that do not support passive mode.
		      If your connection hangs with passive mode (the
		      default), try active!</para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		
		<varlistentry><term>FTP Passive</term>
		  
		  <listitem>
		    <para>For all FTP transfers, use &ldquo;Passive&rdquo; mode. This
		      allows the user to pass through firewalls that do not
		      allow incoming connections on random port
		      addresses.</para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
	      </variablelist>
	    
	    
	    <note>
	      <para>Active and passive modes are not the same as a &ldquo;proxy&rdquo;
		connection, where a proxy FTP server is listening and
		forwarding FTP requests!</para>
	    </note>
	    
	    <para>For a proxy FTP server, you should usually give name of the
	      server you really want as a part of the username, after an
	      @-sign. The proxy server then 'fakes' the real server. An
	      example: Say you want to install from <hostid role="fqdn">ftp.freebsd.org</hostid>, using the
	      proxy FTP server <hostid role="fqdn">foo.bar.com</hostid>, listening on port 1234.</para>
	    
	    <para>In this case, you go to the options menu, set the FTP
	      username to ftp@ftp.freebsd.org, and the password to your e-mail
	      address. As your installation media, you specify FTP (or
	      passive FTP, if the proxy support it), and the URL

	      <literal>
		ftp://foo.bar.com:1234/pub/FreeBSD
	      </literal></para>

	    <para><filename>/pub/FreeBSD</filename> from
	      <hostid role="fqdn">ftp.freebsd.org</hostid> is proxied
	      under <hostid role="fqdn">foo.bar.com</hostid>, allowing you to install from <emphasis>that</emphasis> machine
	      (which fetch the files from <hostid role="fqdn">ftp.freebsd.org</hostid> as your installation
	      requests them).</para>
	    
	  </sect3>
	</sect2>
      </sect1>
      
      <sect1>
	<title>Installing FreeBSD</title>
	
	<para>Once you have taken note of the appropriate preinstallation
	  steps, you should be able to install FreeBSD without any further
	  trouble.</para>
	
	<para>Should this not be true, then you may wish to go back and
	  re-read the relevant preparation section above for the installation
	  media type you are trying to use, perhaps there is a helpful hint
	  there that you missed the first time? If you are having hardware
	  trouble, or FreeBSD refuses to boot at all, read the Hardware Guide
	  provided on the boot floppy for a list of possible solutions.</para>
	
	<para>The FreeBSD boot floppy contains all the on-line documentation
	  you should need to be able to navigate through an installation and
	  if it does not then we would like to know what you found most
	  confusing. Send your comments to the &a.doc;. It is the objective
	  of the FreeBSD installation program (sysinstall) to be
	  self-documenting enough that painful &ldquo;step-by-step&rdquo; guides are no
	  longer necessary. It may take us a little while to reach that
	  objective, but that is the objective!</para>
	
	<para>Meanwhile, you may also find the following &ldquo;typical
	  installation sequence&rdquo; to be helpful:</para>
	
	
	  <orderedlist>
	    
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Boot the boot floppy. After a boot sequence which can
		take anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes, depending on your

	<title>MS-DOS User's Questions and Answers</title>
	
	<para>Many FreeBSD users wish to install FreeBSD on PCs inhabited by
	  MS-DOS. Here are some commonly asked questions about installing
	  FreeBSD on such systems.</para>
	
	<para><emphasis>Help! I have no space! Do I need to delete
	    everything first?</emphasis></para>
	
	<para>If your machine is already running MS-DOS and has little or no
	  free space available for FreeBSD's installation, all is not lost!
	  You may find the FIPS utility, provided in the <filename>tools</filename> directory on the FreeBSD CDROM or on the
	  various FreeBSD ftp sites, to be quite useful.</para>
	
	<para>FIPS allows you to split an existing MS-DOS partition into two
	  pieces, preserving the original partition and allowing you to
	  install onto the second free piece. You first defragment your
	  MS-DOS partition, using the DOS 6.xx DEFRAG utility or the Norton
	  Disk tools, then run FIPS. It will prompt you for the rest of the
	  information it needs. Afterwards, you can reboot and install
	  FreeBSD on the new free slice. See the
	  <emphasis>Distributions</emphasis> menu for an estimation of how
	  much free space you will need for the kind of installation you
	  want.</para>
	
	<para><emphasis>Can I use compressed MS-DOS filesystems from
	    FreeBSD?</emphasis></para>
	
	<para>No. If you are using a utility such as Stacker(tm) or
	  DoubleSpace(tm), FreeBSD will only be able to use whatever portion
	  of the filesystem you leave uncompressed. The rest of the
	  filesystem will show up as one large file (the stacked/dblspaced
	  file!). <emphasis>Do not remove that file!</emphasis> You
	  will probably regret it greatly!</para>
	
	<para>It is probably better to create another uncompressed MS-DOS
	  primary partition and use this for communications between MS-DOS and
	  FreeBSD.</para>
	
	<para><emphasis>Can I mount my MS-DOS extended
	    partitions?</emphasis></para>
	
	<para>Yes. DOS extended partitions are mapped in at the end of the
	  other &ldquo;slices&rdquo; in FreeBSD, e.g. your <devicename>D:</devicename> drive might be <filename>/dev/sd0s5</filename>,
	  your <devicename>E:</devicename> drive <filename>/dev/sd0s6</filename>, and so on. This example assumes, of
	  course, that your extended partition is on SCSI drive 0. For IDE
	  drives, substitute <filename>wd</filename> for <filename>sd</filename> appropriately. You otherwise
	  mount extended partitions exactly like you would mount any other DOS
	  drive, e.g.:</para>
	
	<informalexample>
	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t msdos /dev/sd0s5 /dos_d</userinput></screen>
	</informalexample>
	
	<para><emphasis>Can I run MS-DOS binaries under
	    FreeBSD?</emphasis></para>
	
	<para>BSDI has donated their DOS emulator to the BSD world and this
	  has been ported to FreeBSD.</para>
	
	<para>There is also a (technically) nice application available in the
	  <link linkend="ports">The Ports Collection</link> called pcemu
	  which allows you to run many basic MS-DOS text-mode binaries by
	  entirely emulating an 8088 CPU.</para>
