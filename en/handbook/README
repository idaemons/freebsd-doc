This will be the location of the DocBook version of the FreeBSD Handbook,
which will eventually obsolete the version currently in doc/handbook/.

The conversion process will start at roughly GMT 1830, 1/4/1998. Interested
parties should examine

  <URL:http://www.nothing-going-on.demon.co.uk/FreeBSD/docbook-migration.html>

and get in touch with Nik Clayton (either to nik@FreeBSD.ORG or via the
FreeBSD-doc mailing list).
